1680105	[Laughter]	1
1905405	Wouldn't you think prosecutors ought to do that normally?	1
5828984	I know the Secretary has not.	1
28207	If it was an arrestable offense, yes, Your Honor, I think that's correct.	0
960500	Is it like a voucher program in that sense?	0
8213889	Is it theoretically possible that the legislative council could be... which enacts the rules could be composed of a majority of private school principals?	1
990511	--Mr. Baker, one of the problems since we're dealing with a pro se litigant, gets this form from the Sixth Circuit, and it doesn't say, as the... the sample attached to the Rules do, S with a signature.	1
1751584	Now, let's say we read it that way.	0
7505735	I just couldn't find anything that really showed me what we were dealing with.	1
6050209	Well, the United States can sue for damages without an Eleventh Amendment problem.	1
4602648	Because I mean that's what I'm trying to get a response to.	1
4772671	--the welfare standards, wouldn't it?	1
7314158	or --	1
205024	There was the portion of the transcript, the guilty plea transcript we just referred to.	0
3252239	[Laughter]	1
2829994	Well, usually variations in language mean variations in meaning.	1
5452966	Well, if they said they don't want to do it, then why are you arguing to the contrary?	1
2416541	Has Illinois showed no interest at all or concern about this particular site?	1
7491953	Is that--	1
9315934	Not necessarily.	1
1785498	There are limited... they have to be accompanied by, what is it, a legal guardian?	0
2390292	Is it necessary that we go further than that?	0
4645047	We've been very insistent that you can't keep it away from adults, although a lot of people think it's addictive and harmful.	1
8339645	Well, how about the simple pro... does the statute say it has to be in writing?	1
1478065	What we have is a system that allows a reasonable time.	0
3050845	Here there were a couple of other--	1
1123444	Typically, yes, that's the way 2255 works, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
4619937	[Laughter]	1
349804	The petitioner's brief?	1
7711119	--this Sixth Amendment right, and here there was at the time of the burglary charge no evidence of the murder... the murders, or the defendant's connection with them, so why isn't that a separate offense?	1
726329	I could ask the same question with just and reasonable rates.	1
2579855	Because they limit the spending, as you just pointed out, to the party, to the candidate directly to a hundred and some odd thousand dollars.	1
4073931	No, no, I suppose it's nobody's fault, you know.	1
4841530	--But isn't that what is determined in effect in the contract actions that result in the judgments of back pay?	1
4283231	But all you are telling me, General, is that... is that there are... there are reasons why one would pick the higher levels and not pick the lower levels.	1
309412	Well, what about... it... it... section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate relief.	0
3929666	So the rule you would have us follow does result in a... a super technicality in a sense of what... what was on the record at the time of the plea.	1
917977	They're hard for us, too.	0
364680	And that's what actually the Courts of Appeals for the most part have held with respect--	0
6522266	You say those words do not mean, do not include state court.	1
3852162	Why?	1
7150290	Well, we can't... what about the Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer decision, where the Court unanimously found Title VII was a valid abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment immunity, and there was no inquiry into the history of gender discrimination, it was just accepted?	1
6530224	concealed cargo...	1
1044550	There was the -- the statement that was made that it's not reasonable, doesn't give the officers enough time.	0
512019	It's made easy for them by the State... access is made easy... but only access to the bad information.	1
6716696	So we're not dealing with that.	1
2579223	It seems to me you're suggesting that we treat the Congress of the United States as a trial court and remand the case to them to prepare better findings.	1
6574316	Well, what should the police have done to preserve evidence that they know is at risk?	1
1300633	[Inaudible]	1
2395655	shops.	0
5595431	If that is preempted, then suppose they say, it has to be blank, the ad, blank.	1
1632133	It only dealt with the States and governmental entities.	0
5082671	But, that isn't a matter of the record.	1
3203199	What's fair?	1
286347	We don't know enough about it.	1
6548781	You mean, unaware in fact, even if the plaintiff should have been aware?	1
9588669	Well, that doesn't answer my question.	1
1819386	--I'll grant you, and this is directly related to what was just said, that the water has come out from behind the dam in order to make space for other water.	1
2368793	And you ha-	1
2348695	specific...	1
9106862	Is that the same as active inducement--	1
3744070	So... and although being a principal is a condition of being a member, a voting member, can a principal decide, I'm not interested in this and I won't do it?	1
2532537	But, a Tribal Court wouldn't occur to me.	1
580199	But the one difference is, as Justice Scalia points out, it isn't the prime that made the decision to do this.	1
248630	It wasn't their intent to punish.	1
1843917	I think in the record, in the material here, we have a copy.	0
6148570	We can prove with expert testimony that we are cured.	1
3755592	Right.	1
456408	How... how are we supposed to define that term?	0
9231340	The other point that I think is very, very important with respect to that, if the state starts to distinguishing between discussion of a subject and proselytizing, the entanglement problem is going to be enormous.	1
1113041	and r- and and r-	1
5508492	Mr. Chief Justice, the question before the Court is... is purely a Federal question.	1
8271781	and that --	1
2047541	Telecommunications, we we don't have a position.	0
1164113	why.	1
7564630	It's not out of his own pocket, is it, the principal, when he goes to the board it's on State time, or municipal time, whoever hires him?	1
3210090	It asked the parties.	1
8155397	Go ahead.	1
9184121	You haven't the question.	1
6723938	j-	1
6316773	[Inaudible]	1
2721225	That implies an economic criterion.	1
4122996	These are on page 36 of your brief, footnote 26?	1
897162	And -- but that is past the -- that is past the traffic stop.	0
4440545	I mean, the decision to join the association has to be a... you don't acknowledge that that decision is an official public school decision?	1
2915336	Yes, here we think there has to be discovery.	1
232504	But you're you're...	1
7872487	Do you say that the State laws that prohibit children from smoking are invalid somehow?	1
4722572	--Was there some reference to veil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth Circuit?	1
2398587	The--	1
1492751	And the preliminary studies show how...  how much in acre-feet of water year are we talking about, probably?	1
8353067	But Mr. Seideman, what were the suits that you brought?	1
1878881	Well, let me ask you this.	0
4170658	On the whole 300,000?	1
6205180	There may be some Privacy Act concerns, but still, this is truthful information.	1
4842827	Yeah.	1
2911576	All right.	1
1112239	But that certainly doesn't say this is an effort to do what Miranda suggested we do.	1
1967571	Yes, but not that it was unconstitutional to place the discrimination on the basis of that person's age.	1
8773374	A negligence case like the negligence case you just posited to Justice Stevens, that will be the only kind of situation in which there will not be immunity?	1
5673429	--On this so-called lodging--	1
1722149	Is it that the case that... do you now concede that Farr was paid something for his information--	0
6835696	That's... that's... the question Justice Ginsburg started with is every time... you just replied to Justice Scalia... and what I hear are words that seem to apply with equal force to a perfectly-tailored statute that would catch only the most dangerous sex offenders who everyone agrees are virtually uncontrollable and might repeat their offense many, many times.	1
9171348	In... in the Federal court you think they're routinely appointed by the state?	1
4654491	Let's assume that it can be demonstrated that eating regularly at fast food joints, including McDonald's, causes health problems throughout life for kids, would you give me the principle in your reasoning that would prevent the State of Massachusetts from similarly restricting advertising by McDonald's--	1
5387513	It's like the cases involving chinchillas or rabbits, one of these cases involving rabbits, it...  there's two of the...  two of the...	1
470301	isn't maintained, or because it isn't a record?	1
9228359	No, Your Honor. In fact,	1
1049083	It's a -- it's a question about the objective reasonableness of the length of the stop.	0
9622854	I don't know what I'm supposed to say about that.	1
7896411	The Congress then was giving away public lands and was giving away public minerals.	1
271078	It only sets a ceiling, whatever that State law is.	1
2427398	And he did.	1
132820	The federal law prohibits an Indian tribe from accepting... a Tribal Court from accepting jurisdiction in a case like this?	1
2211125	not need that.	1
1103073	say. I'm pre-	1
8881010	And there's an objectively reasonableness component of the lawyer's performance, and a prejudice component.	1
1666691	It was the tribe that proposed using this form.	1
675492	Well, if we were to agree that the Ninth Circuit's per se rule is invalid, would this case still have to be remanded to have the court below consider the circumstances here, where the magistrate said that Ortega wanted to appeal and thought the attorney was going to file an appeal?	1
8650738	That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.	1
3044461	From a standpoint of public policy, why in the world would Congress want to exclude a broadly marketed scheme like this from the definition of investment contract?	1
301645	And I -- the reason I think that is relevant is that the officer -- this is the case in routine traffic stops as well -- the officer has to be reasonably diligent.	0
1716196	Except the preamble is different, right?	0
6317334	Well, the water's left the Federal project in this case, too.	1
1742026	So, the problem with California is we have no time specified.	0
8334095	So the penalty... it's the penalty.	1
2559988	Isn't that really what we're saying?	1
715235	Now, if the state decides not to give school vouchers for use in religious or parochial schools, do you take the position it must, that it has to do one or the other?	1
9529188	[Laughter]	1
9505216	Then, the answer is, is it not... it isn't a severely specific waiver.	1
4063501	Well, but in an opinion where the habeas claim is based on a constitutional right, it makes perfectly good sense to say, here we have a constitutional claim made under the habeas statute, but when Congress says it's not talking about any particular claim that's being raised in a case, such as we do, when it says the denial of a constitutional right, I think it's certainly a very plausible inference it means that and nothing more.	1
641037	Now, what's the response to that?	1
5196598	brief.	1
1799014	But gee, she has to say the basis on which she picked the reasonable point, at least for the arbitrary or capricious point, don't you think?	1
7859561	Well, I don't I I'm not sure either.	1
6443077	court and ask for relief.	1
636649	cable companies...	0
6116791	[Laughter]	1
7901804	Your real objection is that...	1
8940116	--the way... the way they wrote it.	1
8704853	Is that correct?	1
4111233	[Laughter]	1
2461964	I think you've answered the question.	1
6727771	I just don't understand why what you say necessarily follows.	1
6894035	Suppose in the hypothetical case, where Massachusetts bans all advertising at any location of all cigarettes, it recites, because of our concerns with health, all advertising of cigarettes is banned in the State of Massachusetts, would that be preempted?	1
763752	Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire of you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU area, have applied their own disability laws to some of the cruise ships that touch base in their courts?	0
3364670	It's peculiar.	1
4368970	claims.	1
7663822	--You're tapping everything, the register and--	1
7828885	Congress...	1
1359976	What the Court has repeatedly referred to is the...  from the standpoint of the investor, what the investor is expecting to do is to put his or her money to work for him or her, that is to say, put that money into an enterprise of some sort so the investor can sit back and watch the returns come in.	1
7743617	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.	1
5539180	Do you agree that it is a totality of the circumstances test?	1
432198	In -- in Heck and Wallace, this Court envisioned the criminal case and the civil case being pursued at the same time.	0
2978621	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.	1
2918424	--and protects the miner of the hard coal.	1
8612615	Nothing else is relevant.	1
2216810	in this case.   Yes.	1
8432751	Sometime during your argument, could you address that?	1
3856699	that there is.	1
8741035	next year perhaps eliminating the writing requirement.	1
427935	Yes.	0
4553553	Do you do you think it's...	1
1133720	Is there any special call made, or is the credit card just submitted to the store and the store processes it and if it's not rejected, it goes through?	0
3608228	[Laughter]	1
8285200	In either event, it... it amounts to a decrease in the amount of evidence necessary to convict.	1
4198749	The first is Section 323(a), the across-the-board criminal prohibition on national parties can be well contrasted with Section 323(e), which addresses Federal officeholder solicitation.	1
7716402	And yet that's a tremendously intrusive burden on a political party's rights as well, isn't it?	1
7423267	Is that it?	1
4030158	barred.	1
1021489	But your argument is a little extreme in the situation where, by State law, the defendant has to be there, and any time the defendant testifies, even if it's totally consistent with his prior but excluded confession, you say the prosecutor can nonetheless get up in summation and try to use his presence at the trial against him.	0
1976942	If you are correct that Section 502(a) preempts, is it possible that under ERISA 502(a)(3), that the plaintiffs might recover some money, for example, for pain and suffering and things like that?	0
162254	Now, those are available...	1
7859873	Mr. Hufstedler, I guess the Ninth Circuit was persuaded by what it read into the words, in any election--	1
5592734	Okay, and that was a... that really stretched the statute, didn't it?	1
1654446	around it's...	1
1512943	Now, can he establish that in Virginia--	0
9470	--Yes.	0
1604354	If that's--	1
702028	Does it show it was a vehicle?	1
361517	It doesn't... at least to say what... whether the crime was a misdemeanor or a felony, the disclaimer certainly to... to say, now we are not labeling this person a forever sex offender.	1
7247763	in looking at the manual task approach, how how is the fact finder supposed to decide which manual tasks are sufficiently important to constitute a substantial limitation? I mean, how do you weigh that? H- how do we decide it? Is there any guidance on that?	1
6526258	tax...	1
3720902	Well, but I mean, how is that different?	1
6916791	Why couldn't it?	1
1894865	Well, that's not what this judge did.	1
1477661	[Laughter]	1
7189151	What's the matter with that?	1
75211	[Laughter]	1
4490902	Under law 280.	1
4650049	How many states have a prohibition of this sort, do you know?	1
5538470	Well you're...	1
8665449	Of course,	1
387242	There would be a duty to advise of appeal rights, because there are arguable grounds for appeal, but there would be no duty to file the appeal.	0
5655996	So why does it make any difference if they simply, instead of picking one percentage, charge 5 percent on the parimutuel and 34 percent on the slot machines?	1
890250	--Well, as we said in our brief, when that situation occurs, courts have upheld stops of up to, you know, 35 minutes, something like that.	0
55782	Doesn't that require a cut as well?	0
2684302	It may be it had in mind Torres and the problem of the person other than the one who files the notice, adding names.	1
76981	I want a criterion for why she drew the line at 0.8.	1
1313820	How specifically do you want us to read it?	1
6229360	Yes.	1
3464962	says, and...	1
506833	Have we ever allowed a prospective waiver of a statutory right--	0
8987722	So, the tribe in effect has asked the contractor to use a term which in fact is totally meaningless, utterly misleading, and apparently an act of intentional bad faith.	1
540412	And if so, what is it?	0
300988	Can you point to the record anyplace where you took the position below that Federal law could not and did not apply?	1
8300004	You're concerned that the last sentence-- that finding?	1
5037828	Is it jurisdictional, do you think, here as well as in the court of appeals?	1
2562688	Now, I'm putting that whole thing out to get your comment.	1
1690587	The State can simply take that, and I have no remedy?	1
5086865	is that it?	1
1408282	That was just simply a contract case, and we said you couldn't do it without a prior hearing.	1
8086154	But that's no different. But that's no...	1
8430874	What's the principle that you think we should adopt in respect to prejudgment interest in a suit between two States?	1
968595	In fact, the vast majority fail.	0
5358821	Do we?	1
47509	I guess my question is, is it rational speculation when you know it's not true?	1
8868823	Defendant and his counsel say okay.	1
651397	Do you defend the treatment given by the Ninth Circuit to the OPA section?	0
871169	Jurisdiction under Habeas Statute?	0
4192557	For instance, why does a claim that Dow negligently failed to field test its product on peanuts on acid soil impose a label requirement?	1
5318587	No.	1
4962464	Absolutely. If...	1
1950761	you can sell adult VHS tapes but not Beta tapes in the same store?	1
1136887	for the Government to satisfy.	1
8646863	--in this case.	1
9301596	[Laughter]	1
9269209	absolutely the State's position.	1
155876	Then you have 30 days or whatever it is to go to the court of appeals.	0
1610743	pole...	0
599375	We don't know whether the taxpayer here was paying the minimum wage, because none of that was in the record, because the assessment amount was conceded.	0
4958487	The two dates, or the findings with respect to the two dates struck me as being at least possibly in tension.	1
2332487	[Inaudible]	1
537071	needs of prison administration.	1
1792914	It means they...	0
4701822	Then I misunderstood you, I think.	1
185359	The whole thing?	0
1548321	I... I thought PLRA became effective April 26th, 1996.	0
166112	--But since the Court said in Caballas that a dog sniff is permissible to perform at stops sometimes, we think that the analysis as to when it is permissible--	0
595054	get the argument out.	1
5763836	[Laughter]	1
7443236	So I'm wondering if we shouldn't just try to look at the facts in this case and ask whether what the supervisors did amounted to a tangible employment action and that would answer the... the question.	1
2294102	He must be diligent going towards the investigation of the traffic stop.	0
620986	He was denied admission, I think, in 1997?	0
8870267	I thought it was here on summary judgment and they take the view, summary judgment should have been given for the officer.	1
2828031	From a standpoint of public policy, why in the world would Congress want to exclude a broadly marketed scheme like this from the definition of investment contract?	1
4093027	I mean, that might be an error...	1
177195	That is... I mean, I read your brief.	1
3787714	Will you make a... like a quick summary... I'm asking you repeat yourself, in a sense, but I... Nierotko's a famous case, and Nierotko--	1
1298026	'87.	1
1962775	worth of wages.	1
6654204	Are you taking coal?	1
1866060	May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips?	0
9526776	I just don't know any analogue for that.	1
2702824	No, by now we're in the federal district court.	1
3858249	[Laughter]	1
1309707	And you've derived the notion of cost from public health.	1
7478237	the evidence.	1
3910887	But then you're saying it has to be Federal authority, the FTC, and the FDA, at the time they thought they might regulate nicotine as a drug--	1
5745456	It's at page fif-	1
37445	That is correct.	0
4197161	Well, what... how do you read that in coordination with the so-called safe-harbor provision for legal advice and so on?	1
9332856	And I I s- suppose...	1
1431258	No.	1
7505447	fifty-eight A thirty-one twenty is where thirty-one twenty-one Q appears, and remember that is a section that provides definitions.	1
8268288	Which is true in any situation in which there's a prime and a sub, so what is different about the fact that the prime in this case has contracted with the State?	1
852466	I mean, it looks like the most obvious source of law on this topic.	0
575187	And you think it did it properly?	0
1406119	These toxins will cause your early death.	0
8818158	And there were no interstate branches in 1887, I assume.	1
8313712	[Laughter]	1
6967736	All right, now, the language in this particular settlement agreement gave up claims arising out of or relating to the matter of the State court litigation.	1
107318	Well, that goes to the issue on remand if there is one.	0
5769147	who, in the end, have to change their conduct.	1
3153946	Well, under what circumstances could the district court exercise its discretion and not dissolve the injunction and require litigation of liability in Federal court?	1
8662952	I would have thought the right question is, of the area previously available for advertising, in how much of that area can you no longer advertise as a result of this, and I can't get an answer to that question from the map, and the map only covers Boston and not the suburbs.	1
6076164	I don't think so, Your Honor.	1
6868576	be an impairment...	1
90547	It's the joint appendix.	0
5208512	Yes, but the--	1
8131868	It's sort of hard to find, looking back at the settlement agreement and the orders that were entered, that the people in respondent's category were thought to be covered.	1
8668500	In 323(e)(1)(B), there is a specific allowance for Federal officeholders to raise non-Federal money up to the analogous Federal limit for state and local candidates.	1
63772	Your expert, Mr. Weber, said that the defendant's expert, Mr. Peterson, used an unconventional, untried theory.	1
2040436	And... and in Chandris, this Court rejected the snapshot approach to determining what's a vessel and the First Circuit seemed to go back to that.	0
8948026	I I...	1
5722843	Do you, do you contest the, I guess, intuitive assumption that if a candidate had the choice of retaining the present limits on contributions directly to that candidate, and on the other hand, having a system in which there were no contribution limits, he could accept any amount from anybody, do you, do you contest the intuitive judgment that he would probably accept the latter system and say, sure, let me accept any amount of money?	1
1431647	Maybe I'm not reading it right--	0
8171945	Where is it written that you can only warn the public about those whom you have... are sure are dangerous?	1
882661	necessarily.	1
277699	It's not just like the year-end bonus, or something like that.	1
97098	So there has been no discovery at all from the policy group, and you claim, of course, that they are totally exempt under the plain language of the statute.	1
630437	So... so presumably in... well in advance he could anticipate a problem.	0
9333844	time.	1
6740415	I'm worried about the implications there for the compliance by a state with a mandate of the Supreme Court and that's what I'd like you to think through for me.	1
2830153	--The... the national parties are constrained by, are constrained by Federal statute purportedly pursuing a Federal interest in, in their activities relating to a Federal, to a state and local election.	1
501224	Yes.	1
5351767	charge one thing...	1
9102902	to say that was compulsion.	1
5582259	Then you're not relying on Public Law 280?	1
9272617	Yes.	1
1186457	court support for...	1
583226	duration...	1
4213370	--Exactly, when there were no Federal candidates on the ballot, odd-year elections.	1
4934032	But it didn't want there to be complete immunity, did it?	1
8796501	I don't quite understand how it --	1
9134479	[Laughter]	1
5520165	Massachusetts says, in the State of Massachusetts you cannot advertise cigarettes anywhere, on any billboard, or on any store sign.	1
783900	Thank you, Mr. Smith the case is submitted.	1
3705514	Mr. DuMont...	1
111661	Why doesn't that--	1
594668	[Laughter]	1
9323481	Has Illinois showed no interest at all or concern about this particular site?	1
4454379	But in response to Justice O'Connor's question, there are no exigent circumstances of the type that would eliminate the need to knock and announce at all.	1
4979198	Well, let's say you do assert the rights to the gas.	1
7831516	Well, I'm not just saying anything about pro se... just someone types in his own name and two other names of people who were parties in the district court but who haven't signed it.	1
3749774	The trial court says a convenient date for trial is May 1.	1
2227727	No, but the decision has to be made on whether these people are employees.	1
4631163	We're not talking about soft money here, right?	1
6690808	Is that right?	1
9379086	expressing now, into its opinion?	1
1081873	Without ever being on reservation land.	1
531613	In other words, is it conceivable that a statute which is valid in response to a facial attack could nevertheless be invalid as applied in particular cases?	1
911626	does it...	1
7206293	That was a much more limited case--	1
1010506	Right.	0
9647872	Well, Ms. Brinkmann, th-	1
4302873	If you're going to release somebody back into society, you don't want to cut off all contact with family members or friends who might help that person on release, do you?	1
1201853	So, you know, it probably isn't burdensome to... in principle, to have some disaffiliation requirement, but does the State have to allow enough time so that the decision can be made with knowledge of whether the Libertarians are going to be on the ballot?	1
7367833	the sole...	1
8329496	[Laughter]	1
4447868	Why would the prime contractor have a defense to your lawsuit merely because the prime contractor has lost his defense to the Government's withholding?	1
8541779	It tells us that it's been getting permits under this Federal scheme and that it's been helpful.	1
9241488	was it not?	1
6573702	circumstance where a cus-	1
6453715	Federal habeas.	1
3316871	--that was so clear to the parties at the time, and you say it is and... and what they... what they were anticipating is a change in the Federal--	1
5357009	Number tw--	1
1503672	Why not? Literally it...	1
1266394	magically, since its concession in the district court, at the appellate level and again in its briefs before this Court, the respondent has come up with all sorts of ideas that might challenge the amount of the assessment.	1
7124748	They're not drilling into your coal deposit.	1
7849484	I have not specified something.	1
963763	You said to regulate the person himself.	1
8970831	Mr. Frederick, we'll hear from you.	1
6259110	It covers any funds that the party has, so it is prophylactic.	1
1444863	interest in the property.	1
1806000	--No, I think -- I think we -- we admit that the -- that the dog sniff can prolong the traffic stop, that it is not a routine part of every single traffic stop.	0
880784	Those are things, Your Honor, that have been accepted as part of--	0
4045445	next year perhaps eliminating the writing requirement.	1
1424677	Yes.	1
1239013	It sounds like the ALJ's description was probably... didn't get it quite right, and I take it that your opposing counsel here concedes as much.	0
2040296	Were there the same consequences then as there were post-AEDPA?	0
3420568	I assumed that that was how we were deciding it.	1
684383	That is --	1
1302733	--Federal Government seems to be trying to provide those incentives.	0
7129375	Right.	1
4902681	How does this violate the student's right to free exercise of religion?	1
6071305	If it isn't a Fifth Amendment right itself, what is it, and how do we have the power to--	1
5997176	I mean, if water is... someone is drowned in a boat accident as a result of flood waters being released out of a dam, you have a single incident that occurs right then.	1
5870940	Well, the commission has...	1
1210326	So, again, I think the only interest at stake from the individual's point of view is the interest against unreasonable delay.	0
1603787	Is that possible?	0
1065911	Well, don't take your time to look it up.	0
235159	--But form 58... I'm... I'm looking at page 58... says that the prisoner will be given this form that says you were referred to the classification committee for the following reasons.	1
588157	Well, yes, Your Honor, if the issue of sentencing is left completely open...	0
3841113	This was a little odd.	1
3949324	means.	1
415475	Well, so is recklessness enough or not?	0
321285	Well, let's talk about the jurisdictional language...	0
1771262	Are we talking about this person as an as-applied challenge, or do we have a facial challenge?	0
1464010	Well, your opponent flatly disagrees with you, doesn't he, on that?	0
8764367	I see.	1
7242283	How would you characterize the Ninth Circuit rule?	1
2744398	Do you know--	1
6397493	[Laughter]	1
8221139	Thank you, Mr. Kerrigan.	1
7225714	But they...	1
7698866	That seems to me just completely contrary to the whole idea of the truth that the First Amendment is designed to vindicate.	1
8672665	But in deciding summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue I would assume we would assume he wasn't resisting and then go ahead and resolve the issue.	1
707311	If there's an arguable issue for appeal, then an attorney has a duty to advise of those appeal rights.	0
1066298	or adult motels.	1
687695	[Laughter]	1
1708984	It is u- U- United States versus Janis stands for the proposition that an assessment is valid unless it is without any foundation.	0
2169364	But I thought here it was alleged this morning that the juror in question was asked if anyone had represented her and she said no.	0
4747456	Well, if it's the early 1940's, it's before the Administrative Procedure Act, and they probably weren't adopted by notice of--	1
7635617	If you make a mistake here about a person's dangerousness, the consequences could be very grave.	1
2102498	And this is just a regulatory scheme to... to make that information more clear as to how many people are in the community have suffered that conviction.	1
1897435	Well, the circumstances that you were given was a traffic offender.	0
9182409	Well, what would we do in that situation?	1
1487915	I'm asking a simple question.	1
1104649	This comes close because you say it's unconstitutional to proceed with lethal injection under these circumstances.	0
5723435	And the district court didn't deal with it, and then it went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and it didn't deal with that issue, either.	1
6779722	--But explain again what you mean now?	1
413381	whether this is harmless error?	0
8718725	And we have a representative of that commissioner here before us today saying that under the statutory and regulatory scheme, that payments such as these for foster care are in the best interests of the child.	1
211050	I mean, all that would show... all you're claiming is that some people who are not dangerous are... are wrongly covered by this regulatory measure.	1
7102186	Well, I... I thought you were talking about Justice Scalia's--	1
2256581	It is used in the proximate cause sense, and that is an element of -- of the analysis in those cases.	0
712695	Whether the--	0
5319234	by these conditions.	1
2715211	dollars of taxes of the husband.	1
1563628	But now we're, now we're... what I'm positing is a system in which the political party, which everybody esteems for different reasons, perhaps, but everybody supports, now, on your theory the political party can simply be given another useful task and the useful task, in effect, would be to eliminate the need of the candidate to be scrambling for the $100 contributions if it could accept, in effect, through the party, contributions in the amounts that Justice Breyer was talking about in his hypo a while ago.	1
6021853	When you get to the second point, and I don't mean to spoil your order, but will you sort of take up where we left off on the problem that we... some of us seem to be having in finding that there was knowledge, or should have been knowledge in '69.	1
3314384	on the major life activity.	1
2625100	But the idea...	1
6421193	--(i)--	1
1800469	And is that done without regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have entered into?	0
8754043	--In any case you didn't get that alternative instruction so we don't get into Roberts, right?	1
6481636	It it's extraordinary...	1
3738527	On the other hand I don't know if he can just hold the matter in abeyance.	1
8104620	I think --	1
380917	If -- what has to happen is the officer must be diligent.	0
4310377	Iowa... the Iowa court made the statement, as I understand it, that the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the national Equal Protection Clause had identical requirements at least for the purposes of this case.	1
7422349	But you're trying to discredit the expert witness by showing that some of his factual statements were unsupportable, and I don't think it's up to the trial judge when he has an expert witness to, in effect, do all of the scientific evaluation himself.	1
846866	You think it has...	0
8964360	Would you?	1
4352879	in this case.   Yes.	1
3900227	at that time.	1
7601747	It was... something was called second and successive, and it wasn't.	1
589355	And we don't have before us any conflict preemption under Section 514?	0
8736656	Counsel, you're asking us in this case to say that the stay and abeyance procedure is... is not a valid procedure.	1
583734	You said there was a settlement.	1
4732690	Did he make a finding that it was not the case that Kansas should have known in '69?	1
6695119	Well, do you think there's no public interest in seeing to it that the defendant is tried of these very serious crimes in New York?	1
2858505	I take it that's sometimes a question.	1
8452114	Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.	1
2370840	What are we dealing with here?	0
7683227	Part of your allegation could seem to establish that, if this particular facility is... has no psychiatrist and is in a correction facility, everybody incarcerated there must be punished, I would think.	1
564507	I'm on 23.	1
779405	[Laughter]	0
1469812	Well, in our past Miranda cases I think the Government has taken the position that Miranda warnings are not constitutionally required.	1
1427745	You said you'd give us some reasons why this is important to the Government.	0
1228826	As a tip? I I seem to recall seeing a...	1
4469903	If... if we agreed with your view... and I'm not sure we will... about property including the right to control business assets, it does not, I assume, cover some personal right of somebody to obtain services in the clinic.	1
5719369	They were canvassers. So...	1
4732447	The statute doesn't say that, does it?	1
3510302	there --	1
2313395	Yes, and we have held that a state can abandon sovereignty, as in Massachusetts versus New York.	0
1720223	And how about the common-law research--	0
4413627	severe mental --	1
76189	In your view the error was in denying summary judgment on qualified immunity?	0
3900376	Is that what this person is doing, or is there something different?	1
3280363	that it did start around nineteen ninety-two and nineteen ninety-three, and the information that the IRS is gathering on the forms eighty twenty-seven demonstrated the extent of the problem that Congress suspected did exist about substantial underreporting of tip income.	1
3692498	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
8138679	Mr. Blumstein, you have 2 minutes remaining.	1
3250831	Then the statute runs, and the State says, hey, we told you.	1
655437	[Laughter]	1
6100244	doesn't matter, which you have --	1
7971259	So it's a little hard to look for congressional intent.	1
3922854	Well, excuse me, which is adopted by the body how?	1
2129842	What?	1
3497592	What case do you rely on?	1
6547697	I thought he originally entered a plea to one charge, but he was going to go on to trial on the other.	1
1510397	It seems to me we have three arguments.	1
8278801	What could Congress have provided in section 1658(a) to avoid some of these questions?	1
873389	So, as I understand it, he does want a stay in order that this can be heard.	0
427259	That's the way this Court has read it.	1
2313198	Thank...	1
5811997	[Laughter]	1
1778778	Has he been on supervised release or not?	0
1873759	--Well, because that leads to arbitrary results as I was explaining with Justice Breyer, I think in that hypothetical--	0
2590031	narrow range...	1
7250263	That's the question here.	1
5588910	No.	1
4843910	323(b), the restrictions on state parties, usurps law by imposing this Orwellian definition of Federal election activity which sweeps in virtually, virtually all activities of the state parties during even years, subjects it to a Federal $10,000 limit and then perhaps most invasively imposes the homegrown requirement which makes it difficult, if not impossible, for states to transfer money among themselves.	1
9392920	You're saying they didn't really have to say economy.	1
133705	Well, that was at a time before the AEDPA enactment that tried to put limits, time limits, on these things.	0
3794755	Now, if that phrase were entirely omitted from the statute, would it make any difference in your view?	1
9557684	means.	1
4125298	--what it was the Ninth Circuit panel said.	1
1270794	If -- what we have heard and what we have read in the briefs is the mischief that it's caused where the parties do not identify, pinpoint the constitutional right involved, even after decades of urging by the --	0
3184753	I mean, even if you're correct on your premise that a court doesn't have to inform a defendant of the statute of limitations, is... is the issue of possible misleading of the defendant open on the remand even if you were successful?	1
9158973	Then what the Government wants is yet another extension, and what Justice Breyer was proposing, and that is that any facility that is even used in part for flood control purposes, all the water passing through that facility, including the nonflood water part, becomes flood waters.	1
877504	Mr. Barnard, would you be making your same argument and seeking release if the Government were holding someone like your client in a detention center as opposed to a prison facility, or were ordered to remain in his own house and not leave it?	0
1268987	Palm Beach.	0
9310051	Would you state again what you say the second error was?	1
4710936	How are these regulations based on... the ones that you say are prohibited, how are they based on health?	1
8986126	Congress had to approve it.	1
6028884	--if you would.	1
6814111	But, that isn't a matter of the record.	1
1017986	Okay.	1
6072755	Yes, we do.	1
6240239	where will I find that?	1
8503672	I... I rather thought that's what Chevron was all about.	1
9080758	We submit that the teachings of the decision of this Court...	1
325893	Thank you, General Underwood.	1
947829	factual record...	1
5126563	Does the State...	1
3839112	court found...	1
404082	Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.	1
9584232	Assuming that they are the same.	1
646259	Did you... did the subcontractor here ask for a hearing?	1
1380777	As long as the person, the officer, is diligently working towards the mission--	0
4678390	Do you think there's a difference at all in application of such a policy to commercial entities and groups, as opposed to private membership groups?	1
5955859	Well, question...	1
4534184	[Inaudible]	1
27173	But on the test.	0
1470369	Not even a typewritten name, because in the first part of your argument you say you don't need the signature, so if I apply that to your second part of the argument... we have appeals, we don't know who has appealed.	1
2148459	Well, don't we have to give some weight to the EEOC view?	0
6555857	I mean, can't we assess whether... in determining whether it affects substantial rights, how the evidence against the defendant was, what the benefits of the plea were, and what he was told in just objective terms?	1
2171739	The brief didn't...	1
382212	In other words, it is not... but your argument is not that the settlement covered what he claims.	1
2003002	Where are we?	1
4305032	Sorry.	1
7597018	It did have genuine flood, water escaping through the system and somebody drowning as a result when it flooded over.	1
5992132	All right.	1
6675228	Is that testimonial or not?	1
7230356	Mr. Sarnowski, did the State raise the 2253(c) problem, the applicability of AEDPA and the timeliness, the failure to file, get a certificate of appealability?	1
7808901	right? That's That's...	1
3629858	--That gets you into the argument of whether there is an ordinary meaning of final.	1
3267594	Well, we have said that the... in Minnesota v. the United States, I think we said that a proceeding against property in which the United States has an interest is a suit against the United States.	1
375434	And it is a little curious that the State isn't willing to talk to the prisoner's counsel about considering one of the other ways of doing it.	1
2327063	That is to say even though a deliberateless... deliberateness instruction was not given, you don't concede that it would have been irrational for the jury to find that since this defendant did not have adequate mental capacity, he did not act with the requisite deliberateness?	1
9670545	[Laughter]	1
1809176	Right, and that was rejected by this Court in Chandris.	0
4394461	Do you know?	1
6757920	Now, have I read the newspapers wrong or is that possibly practice in respect to some political candidates?	1
7320660	discuss in a moment.	1
5946579	And I suppose Colorado did not know in fact, but he found that Colorado should have known in '69.	1
1281171	Did those arise because the owners attempted to dispose of the estate separately after they'd made a previous conveyance of the coal right, or--	1
7156287	You're saying there is an absolute right to be free from compelled medication.	1
1059434	They're...	0
285571	But the cause of action does require the jury to decide, in effect to second guess the FDA?	0
843469	Well, actually this Court should decide it upon the...	1
339232	I mean, that's what it suggests anyway.	0
1566893	And for income tax purposes of the employees, it would be... we're talking back pay.	1
1268527	What Equal Access Act are you talking about?	1
4137389	You refer to prior cases, and you say, a State court ordered G & G and DLSE to mediate, and a settlement was reached.	1
9178138	wouldn't?	1
8844492	Isn't that right?	1
1904563	I assume that whatever counsel was representing the State at that time thought there was sufficient grounds to justify entering into a consent decree, unless you want to take the position that the attorney was acting totally ultra vires.	0
4726832	But here, it has to do with the way the whole facility was constructed, and that seems to me to be a harder case for you.	1
1245599	It won't apply them on collateral review at the State level.	0
3728252	Number two, and to go to Justice O'Connor's question, the potential effect of corruption, the potential corruptive effect of such donations is minuscule, nonexistent, attenuated at best, in the words of Colorado I.  The $15.6 million, by the way, that the RNC spent in state and local election activity in 2001 was 30 percent of the non-Federal money the party raised that year, 30 percent.	1
5604649	Do you join the amici in saying Almendarez-Torres has to be overruled?	1
2229153	And you don't concede it.	0
4359302	Well, but I thought... I thought you were saying even if the lawyer had not signed it, it would not be jurisdictional.	1
4278643	I still would like to understand why you think an objective test is not acceptable.	1
5859805	The honorable court is adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.	1
925476	Not necessarily, Justice Kennedy.	1
465689	explain that he wouldn't be presenting any evidence or saying anything more?	0
2259964	Well--	0
3866623	Do you do you think it's...	1
1340278	What... in... in the range of Megan's Laws that all the States have, how many treat this as something you can get out of by showing you're not dangerous?	1
8783992	President.	1
4863321	So if I'm correct about what I think Hohn stood for, you'd say it was wrong and we should get rid of it?	1
4524793	competent to assist his lawyers. There's a difference there.	1
398566	And was found ultimately guilty of--	0
6185224	All right then however... you see what I'm getting at.	1
2305935	But if he is able to a dog sniff within a reasonable amount of time and not have the traffic stop exceed the duration of a reasonable, routine traffic stop, then he ought to be able to do that.	0
7968469	So, in your view, the only thing at issue is fees earned, if you will, after the effective date of PLRA?	1
7118032	Now, if they applied that to people who were convicted after they passed it, would that be ex post facto?	1
2251514	He was denied admission, I think, in 1997?	0
812886	--Within that 20 to 40 percent, whatever it may be, do you have any kind of a rough guess as to the number of instances of this issue that arise?	1
4322020	"""If you find there any mitigating circumstances in this case. """	1
7431664	What is wrong with 323(b) in the First Amendment realm is that it does restrict the ability of state and local parties, as well as national parties to pool their resources.	1
4835084	Would your answer here be exactly the same if there had been 12 African American prospective jurors and all 12 were struck?	1
8305083	So purely as an accounting...	1

440376	Well, the disclosure means that it certainly is not anonymous.	1

672688	--adjudicating the correctness of the application of rules for wholesale rates that are contained of thousands or millions of words filed before the Federal Power Commission.	1
319935	And normally we wouldn't take jurisdiction over the interpretation of the statute I guess.	1
1974200	--And that would lead to arbitrary results.	0
1584263	play on words, then.	1
455479	What's fair?	1
2428587	be on a list...	1
1036809	Mr. Warren, we'll hear from you.	1
5857743	The court of appeals didn't address it, and for purposes of deciding special needs we just assume no consent.	1
1564540	Okay.	1
3268947	In fact, the court should grant relief on ineffectiveness grounds on direct appeal only in situations such as the one that confronted the Court in Kimmelman, where there was an extended dialogue between trial counsel and the trial court concerning trial counsel's assertively deficient decision--	1
230317	Well, we rejected...	1
3075626	So come back and tell us how we know when there's a consensus.	1
1714014	You don't need all that.	0
865023	Yes, Your Honor.	1
1954102	Then I misunderstood you, I think.	1
3875930	I thought that there was a finding in... that the principals who attend these meetings are customarily reimbursed.	1
6367019	It starts by saying, no statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in advertising, and so on.	1
3172415	I mean, what's unequivocal depends on what you have in your... maybe I'm not enough of a westerner.	1
5704245	--It's not provided it doesn't cost too much--	1
6629085	for their...	1
5762329	Call it...	1
2529385	is...	1
1166083	Now, that was traditional, wasn't it--	1
9381595	It'd be a...	1
5167080	Or an ATM.	1
2254288	Well, first of all, that would be just an allegation, which is why a prompt investigation would be needed.	0
4558376	I mean, as far as the Federal legislation is concerned, a State that tells the whole truth... is that... that kind of law is totally acceptable within the Federal requirement, isn't it?	1
3963578	[Laughter]	1
2010520	Now try it and speak up, if you...	0
8301812	The Ninth Circuit let me answer the jurisdictional point first.	1
8798968	I mean, they'd have to say we're changing our law.	1
8350654	If, after all, it's not punishment to put a person in a cell... and I thought it was, but the majority thought it wasn't... why is it punishment, following the law, to simply require the person to make reports four times a year?	1
4620466	Well, I'm asking you to.	1
4231903	It's pro-	1
1339642	but it's not.	1
6432541	cows and all that...	1
1492494	Is that what's happening?	0
7284996	I mean, the statute does require the scientific committee to look at all those things and to report it to the EPA.	1
7590858	I'm looking at your brief, at page 3.	1
8585572	The rules in that area ought to be pretty clear.	1
9473048	[Inaudible]	1
4866515	You're turning your answers on the fact that you can't earmark the, the circuitous route, and so for my assumptions to be correct, I have to be assuming a fact that's debatable, and that is that the tally system works approximately similar to earmarking, but on my assumption that that's factually true, we get to my questions, but on the assumption it's not factually true, then your answers are... is that the point of disagreement?	1
7207791	On the reservation trust land.	1
3070813	I see that, but... okay.	1
3587725	What... what is... what provisions of the Constitution specifically are you looking to?	1
1807137	[Inaudible]	1
4920808	That's the problem, I guess.	1
3410326	Well, but precisely, but that... that shows that there's an added burden here that was added by the State after the conviction.	1
673830	--explain that to me?	1
1440591	You are supposed to report those matters to Congress.	1
9368655	Let's talk about the standard of the scope of review under the statute, 706, which says that under the APA the reviewing court will hold unlawful agency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law, subsection (A).	1
9197147	--you do agree, do you not, that the Government does not agree with you on this point?	1
1415170	We're not aware that--	1
5976111	--You mean to repair it or to replace it?	1
204630	We're just going to look at our own.	0
938243	I don't want to consume your...	1
5522275	the laws...	1
2176518	That's flatly inconsistent with the command in the special issue that because at least ten jurors have a reasonable doubt we must answer no.	1
63638	The state and local and national parties annually pool their resources for voter mobilization plans to get their voters to the polls.	1
1757975	type...	1
2194217	And I suppose it's possible that that stands, but conceivably he's entitled to a hearing on the sentencing aspect.	0
9490874	determination.	1
5236002	--Well, at that point at least there would be... I... I assume your... your point would be that there... there is at least a... a credible basis to say that if it covers only those who are affirmatively shown to be dangerous, the object is simply to apprise the public to who is dangerous, and that doesn't sound very punitive.	1
8691391	Well, the big one is just...  it's too small to see.	1
8718533	I understand.	1
1505355	It was not Castro's urging.	0
2262679	after-acquired evidence rule.	1
8409719	right?	1
8078031	mean,	1
769148	With... with non-visible restraints.	0
9196876	even though they need...	1
922339	Do you think that it includes liberty interest deprivation?	1
1394228	I suppose any candidate would feel sympathetic to someone who was agreed to give $80,000 to the State party, which he knows will be used to support him even though not in coordination with him.	1
3390256	If If...	1
8821296	What is it now?	1
1507018	Well, why shouldn't they... you know, if you want to say a number of different statements, the things that you're relying on are statements also.	1
1681489	And one line you could draw with this statute that wouldn't pose a retroactivity problem, I assume, would be to say that work performed by the lawyer after the effective date is governed by the provisions of the PLRA.	0
2915934	But they...	1
2141412	That's that...	1
3423621	Well, but in an opinion where the habeas claim is based on a constitutional right, it makes perfectly good sense to say, here we have a constitutional claim made under the habeas statute, but when Congress says it's not talking about any particular claim that's being raised in a case, such as we do, when it says the denial of a constitutional right, I think it's certainly a very plausible inference it means that and nothing more.	1
8567581	And also, there there is undoubtedly a State law cause of action in negligence that would lie against both the employee and the employer under respondeat superior.	1
6769040	I take it, then, that the only... that there will always be immunity if the release is, in fact, an intentional release as opposed to the negligent release, because whenever there is an intentional release, as I understand your reasoning, there will be, in fact, the creation of space to hold flood water.	1
2317556	got me...	1
667215	What if--	0
2128514	I mean, the very essence of the party's First Amendment right is to define its own message and send out its own candidate.	0

2841914	The clear and unmistakable message is that religion and preparation for a career in the ministry is disfavored and discouraged.	1
821340	litigation of the issue and findings, and we don't have it here.	0
7829728	I mean, right now they're blaming it on us, and if they want to take the blame themselves... how... how are they appointed?	1
5012787	That is certainly...	1
1498789	like a...	1
6236348	--of fuel.	1
848092	--Well--	0
3522152	Was all this presented so that each jury would understand from what the juror took into the jury room that these were to work together?	1
9651571	Contract disputes are not property under Roth, Zindeman, et cetera.	1
2922731	Congress acknowledged that the a-	1
1819664	Well, you know, the concern we ought to have with your approach is we're going to get into some very tricky questions if we go your route in deciding what's testimonial, and why buy a pig in a poke, in effect?	1
6807589	And the last is a due process?	1
1736347	And you think that was not effective?	0
4868879	I can't practice a particular profession, but I can go out and get a job.	1
5323926	Well, that's true, but I must say when your response to the... one of your responses to the allegation of racial districting is, no, this was incumbent protection, and when the incumbent you're trying to protect is an incumbent who was elected from an unconstitutionally constituted district, that is the prior district which was held to be unconstitutional, I think that the defense of incumbent protection just washes out to say you're going to protect this incumbent means you're going to make sure that the person who was elected by racial gerrymandering will continue to be elected.	1
7586509	That's not...	1

9219452	What about examples cited by the representative of the Solicitor General of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act and other Federal laws that have a similar effect on South Carolina and other States?	1
7484613	Is it 90 percent of them, 50 percent of them, what?	1
1814471	And could that present enough evidence that the fact finder, if it were referred to the fact finder, could find a Batson violation?	1
8933374	Well, I...	1
7905783	They are not capturing methane.	1
8736906	concession, to be sure.	1
7570073	The the...	1
5505509	this a case where the defendant had to be placed on probation? Was there not a jail term that could have been imposed here?	1
3110226	Therefore, substance, not form or title, governs.	1
143911	And what do you propose as the test?	0
9616803	Well, I I...	1
4254576	And doesn't that bring us back to what Justice Scalia said?	1
46679	In other words, you want to support a per se rule no matter what.	0
1639415	can perform --	1
6173602	Everything...	1
3132096	y- the-	1
2823337	severe mental --	1
647176	You concede that by saying each substitution affects the compactness and appearance.	1
8168742	Johnson...	1
2896119	But I thought that was the whole basis that you've just given in your answer to justify what happened here.	1
2008006	--Well, in order to ameliorate that possibility, Justice Souter, the Seventh Circuit, for example, has adopted a standard under which it will not decide a claim of ineffectiveness in the defendant's favor unless there's no possible strategic rationale for counsel's decision and, of course, to the extent that there may be a strategic rationale for the counsel's decision, it'll be in the Government's interest to bring that to the court's attention in its appellate briefing, and we haven't seen too many situations in which a court grants a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal, but yet there was potentially a strategic rationale for counsel's decision.	1
1565879	--haven't either.	1
4863428	Yes, so I don't know why that differs from what I was saying, that if this... except that under the old law you could raise something under a treaty or a Federal statute, and you brought up a rare case, where the underlying claim would be a treaty or a statute, but mostly these are complaints about something that violated your constitutional right, and it's usually some procedural right.	1
6220583	So I think that's a different case.	1
1864646	So it serves free speech for the party to spend money on behalf of a candidate without discussing with that candidate the candidate's views and to make sure that the candidate's campaign is the same as the party.	1
7135816	All right.	1
7201022	But in the real world I'm wondering how this mistake... who caught it?	1
4036588	happened to be...	1
7822678	or adult motels.	1
5710668	[Laughter]	1
6958643	In other words, is it conceivable that a statute which is valid in response to a facial attack could nevertheless be invalid as applied in particular cases?	1
2248195	Certainly the Restatement and the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on this.	0
9260020	There is a law taxing table games at... the revenues from that, at 20 percent.	1
6697292	Well, I guess the one other concern would be the timing in Oklahoma is such that the... the Republican or Democrat who wants to disaffiliate in order to vote with the Libertarians has to do so at a time before the State has decided whether to allow the Libertarian Party on the ballot.	1
6702590	the...	1
8188287	Which is a terribly important set of rights for individuals, is it not?	1
1682760	Would you say generally do not apply?	1
8229743	And now is there anything else...	1
2502688	But you don't have quite the same thing on the Sixth Amendment?	1
256529	And one line you could draw with this statute that wouldn't pose a retroactivity problem, I assume, would be to say that work performed by the lawyer after the effective date is governed by the provisions of the PLRA.	0
3136584	And they're using in effect a... they're creating a kind of presumption in applying that category and that presumption is also inconsistent with the way we wrote James, even if they got the category right, is that--	1
495485	Is get a warrant.	1
798209	And in order to make your opponent's point here, it would have to be a new case.	1
4827211	And it wants now to collect money from Norfolk.	1
8738928	[Laughter]	1
1520067	It was under a different act, not the Pittman Act, but certainly very similar.	0
456525	It sounds like a mess.	1
9105190	--explain that to me?	1
2718303	You're...	1
4386670	What about the heterosexual Scout leader who openly espouses the view that homosexuality is consistent with Scout law and oath, and that it's not immoral?	1
5114265	Right.	1
1451724	It wasn't just a one time payment of a license fee and then you have this forever.	0
4586322	The rules in that area ought to be pretty clear.	1
9547437	Well, maybe, maybe not.	1
949370	There were three named indigents.	0

7299578	is just...	1
226517	Consent...	1
3280120	system.	1
6555208	Yes, but as Justice Scalia has pointed out, it did amend and broaden the preemption provision at the same time that it banned all advertising in electronic media.	1
817172	And what would that dollar amount be here?	1
7372989	Well, what the...  one of the...  one of the things that the Court said in Reves is that, to the extent that there are any ambiguities at the edge and those particular factors were considered in Reves, it...  the...  the scheme of distribution, the nature of the relationships between the individuals, is this...  the...  is someone seeking to acquire money to use as capital in the...  in the operation of an enterprise...	1
6562475	Apparently both the Coast Guard and OSHA agree here.	1
494324	Right?	0
1272420	Your Honor- I'm sorry.	1
7425794	Yes.	1
5768649	impairment --	1
134694	on its face. So...	1
5825134	percent of the population.	1
1964665	Mr. Denvir, in this case it does seem that the Ninth Circuit just didn't apply the Strickland standard in judging this...	1
9229099	But you didn't come up with one example of a swap that would work to make it more compact.	1
9454953	Because as I understood it, the criticism was that he concentrated only on the fringe districts and not the core, but I thought it was the fringe districts that were the problem here.	1
9394070	but...	1
6992381	Exactly.	1
1468385	You say the riverboats, obviously, are located on the rivers which bound Iowa on the east and on the west.	1
1426117	Okay now, is...	0
2438852	The... the... I'm not, don't... I'm accepting this for the sake of argument only.	1
5117022	Is that the same as active inducement--	1
8912916	[Laughter]	1
7936297	And one effect of applying a procedural default principle would be to encourage the raising and resolution of those claims on direct appeal in those situations in which it's appropriate, and I think it's important to point out that there are at least some cases in which a court of appeals can resolve, on the basis of the trial record, that the... that trial counsel either was or was not ineffective, and this Court, for example, in its... in its Kimmelman decision, the... pointed out that trial counsel's ineffectiveness, at least in terms of the performance prong of the Strickland inquiry, was apparent from the trial record, and there will be situations like that that arise every so often, and perhaps more frequently an appellate court will be able to determine that trial counsel's performance was not ineffective and will be able to make that determination perhaps because, no matter how deficient the performance was, the... the particular matter at issue could never have resulted in prejudice for the defendant.	1
89824	in this case.	1
1866611	becomes too much.	1
1155111	What is that requirement?	0
4377045	[Laughter]	1
1968862	Is that something less?	0
7170478	think that...	1
2269385	And satisfied that requirement?	0
4012746	I don't know of any case that so holds.	1
4023285	there.	1
6637241	Why?	1
9465585	Well, that's not fo-	1
4386965	So why is that such, what is, particularly, and I wanted to you to get to this, if the disclosure regulations, the new ones, the new provisions in the law on independent expenditure--	1
49183	Yes, it is.	0
6914791	Wouldn't this have been the most controversial provision in the whole reform package, if that were so?	1
5439125	--I think to paint the picture that we're talking about, just pure speech is... is not the case.	1
4347378	Yes.	1
823456	These people weren't being paid for doing piecework.	1
3723059	Well, it was in separate little packets, right?	1
6902893	will run...	1
4226049	Did you ever ask the prosecution whether Farr was an informant?	1
1631595	I... I don't have statistics of that variety, Justice O'Connor.	1
2201456	Even if all those things that I've said are true.	0
6249176	What result then?	1
6789949	FICA...	1
8599319	to pass a law?	1
2305034	How are they differentiated?	0
607572	If there are no further questions, I will request the remaining for rebuttal.	0
878284	Suppose... I'm now giving you this.	1
6805909	Even though, in fact, it was not prepared by the attorney?	1
4106949	Were the reasons given in this case?	1
8286672	--Well, but it says statement shall be required.	1
6260736	Unilaterally?	1
6112442	let me point out a couple of things from your question, Justice Souter.	1
8843827	--before you have to sit down.	1
5747270	323(b), the restrictions on state parties, usurps law by imposing this Orwellian definition of Federal election activity which sweeps in virtually, virtually all activities of the state parties during even years, subjects it to a Federal $10,000 limit and then perhaps most invasively imposes the homegrown requirement which makes it difficult, if not impossible, for states to transfer money among themselves.	1
8397451	Well, not necessarily.	1
244151	But does the award of damages from Colorado to Kansas in any way affect the Government's operation of those upstream reservoirs?	1
5582842	law f-	1
856364	How should we interpret Taylor?	0
6043069	Didn't we apply it to State courts?	1
4623563	--an example of a case in which there would not be immunity.	1
8117152	Okay, so now what we have is outdoor advertising, in effect, which the State says would encourage children to smoke, so they want to restrict it.	1
47103	because of the reassignment.	1
17295	Now, do you say, under those circumstances, if the court found all of those things, it could not award a civil penalty, at the same time denying an injunction, as a means of deterring continuing violations?	0
6672960	I know.	1
5001526	Well, if it's the early 1940's, it's before the Administrative Procedure Act, and they probably weren't adopted by notice of--	1
4491117	No...	1
2129936	No duty to advise.	0
3481616	Well, I can understand that you could come on behalf of a prisoner on an as-applied challenge, but to look at this form and tell us it is facially invalid is difficult for me to understand.	1
5206936	But that's true... that's true, and so you take those times when in fact the San Joaquin below the dam is filled to more than 7,000... what is it, cubic feet per second.	1
6754082	I do accept that proposition.	1
2532478	They use it in all their contracts.	1
2266100	Then there's no more justification.	0
9183044	Well, excuse me, which is adopted by the body how?	1
9431748	businesses. That's correct. yes, that's...	1
4204611	And could that present enough evidence that the fact finder, if it were referred to the fact finder, could find a Batson violation?	1
667385	Well--	0
6428165	I'm asking a simple question.	1
6631694	Okay.	1
1162749	Okay.	0
3498900	What was being discussed in McCleskey was a constitutional right, so it makes perfectly good sense there to talk about... that language wasn't intended to cover the whole scope of habeas.	1
2094767	Then, at that point, you get to your maps.	1
8240338	[Inaudible]	1
4466896	se-	1
7686925	Well, the record doesn't tell us, but it's just incredible to me that the principal would not be accountable to the Board of Education for the principal's actions in voting.	1
4551440	Well, is that not adequate post-deprivation relief, even if you assume there's some State action and some problem?	1
4673888	I think you have to look at...	1
4131425	But you said something in your reply brief that... that really surprised me.	1
9143066	Did the Tate letter have any coverage prior to '76, the so-called Tate letter from the State Department?	1
411276	--No, that's -- no.	0
8435727	What result there if the State then extends the statute?	1
8950275	But haven't State regulators changed the common law in that regard with unitization and that sort of thing, so that you no longer can, even if the common law allows you, simply drill straight down and drain your neighbor's pool?	1
743015	[Laughter]	1
4153949	Well, it also speaks to routes or weight limitations.	1
6919071	We di-	1
4309118	months.	1
5513842	Yes but in this case there is not a claim comparable to your third example.	1
6035728	With... with--	1
1228757	In that -- in that scenario, each use would be a -- a violation of the due process clause.	0
303612	Could the Government say, nobody is going to be given the addresses of crime victims, period?	0
135170	Right, but they say that the social costs are really achieved in the private sector, and that's why they have this limited thing.	0
920109	So, as I understand it, he does want a stay in order that this can be heard.	0
5351244	Could you do it under any branch of California law?	1
690192	Was this brought out at trial?	1
7363555	Well, the...  the references to the...  to the...  this...  from this...  our perspective, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the return must be examined from the standpoint of the investor, the invest...  and the Court...  I don't think the Court intended to restrict in that case, and the language is not reasonably susceptible in my judgement to the...  to the understanding that that was intended to exclude investments or instruments that provided a fixed return.	1
1431565	Do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?	0
76906	Yeah, but...	0
1769395	And what basic responsibility does that entail, would you say, the fact that the Government is a trustee?	0
5499917	Well, we rejected...	1
44452	drug...	1
8815351	Is that before us in this case?	1
816630	Has anything changed?	1
6587706	very few cases...	1
1368160	Yes.	1
3899324	Well, we don't... I hope we don't have to, at this Court, look at all the evidence and try to sort it out that way.	1
4744582	Yes.	1
2196100	--I think we would -- we would not include the time for a dog sniff--	0
8831922	That's that...	1
9237052	Now, I want you to tell me what, in your view, I would... supposed to be doing.	1
5664670	teacher recording and making...	1
2591146	coming...	1
9261061	Does that weigh in the balance at all?	1
4604173	he did absolutely nothing, then we have to wrestle with whether you divide it from, you know, sentencing phase from guilt innocence phase, and so forth.	1
6443803	They didn't violate that section, did they?	1
2915156	Exactly, yes.	1
1800214	before you.	1
9147367	Ms. Harbury, may I ask you...	1
2162780	But the stipulation does not extend to the student referendum mechanism I gather.	0
891885	And only certain days a week?	0
1793699	--amended the PWSA in some way?	0
9253118	I think Justice O'Connor is right.	1
3701596	I mean, I would think your position could be narrower, which is just that a dismissal without prejudice to permit exhaustion doesn't count as a first petition.	1
347366	This is all very important, but on the legal question that we have, do you take the position that it's a single body of water--	0
2445332	I mean, it seems to me it does.	1
9341153	Wasn't there some... aren't there some words in the labor code to that effect?	1
4834548	323(a) is directed to the national parties.	1
8858816	But it's a civil goal too, I--	1
393604	And don't you think there is a substantial claim?	1
3013228	On the whole 300,000?	1
8958095	not need that.	1
39515	And the underlying goal of the Ex Post Facto Clause you think is served by adopting your position here?	0
7339706	All right.	1
1589457	Yes.	1
1289603	Your Honor, it is -- it is okay when the traffic stop is done.	0
6625783	All right.	1
3663988	Which cuts against what you're saying.	1
1155611	Is that before us in this case?	1
1009032	Do tribal courts routinely hear Section 1983 federal claims?	1
7169688	So, the real real significance of the...	1
514213	We also know that it doesn't impose it doesn't violate any independent scope limitation on traffic stops.	0
2335824	Mr. Robbins, did any... did the petitioners raise the Newport case at any time below?	0
8718003	Well, it was--	1
8663446	In other words, they're assessing a penalty of money against a contractor, and they have to have a fair procedure for doing that.	1
8923870	Yes or no.	1
934570	If, in fact, you go beyond the -- the -- the traffic stop even measurably beyond it, then you have violated the -- the -- the driver's rights, and it is unconstitutional.	0
8023708	--1720, 1729 says that it's lawful for the contractor to withhold if the subcontractor has failed to comply with the terms of this chapter.	1
6822400	The language of the acts, though, is a little different than this, isn't it?	1
2933259	Are you talking about the juror now, and the relationship with the deputy sheriff?	1
1863814	manner t-	1
333395	--that one of your points?	1
8132354	That's your position?	1
199763	And the district court did not deal with individual immunity allegations?	1
5395031	Mr. Frederick, we'll hear from you.	1
9258012	And...	1
654268	--I think that the simple rule, if I -- if I may propose one, is the same one that Professor LaFave has -- has proposed about a traffic stop or a simple stop.	0
5435770	That's extraordinary.	1
8674757	Could they have said in the ad, call your elected representatives, not naming any names?	1
135013	Is the one 3328.3, the one defining waters of the United States?	0
948615	You're not prolonging it, Your Honor, to do a records check.	0
8577647	tenancy by the entirety. It's the marriage that sells it.	1
6042011	[Laughter]	1
491774	And...	0
1065477	--in the baseline that we would use.	0
1183826	Well, following a guilty plea...	0
6819217	Well, what about section 1742.1?	1
6383948	It said simply this, that you're... you're raising an ex post facto claim.	1
5617155	Oh, but as between State sovereigns, I mean, who is going to pay the bill in Colorado?	1
513627	Now, this ad could have been run by your clients by a segregated fund.	0
49790	[Laughter]	0
8407869	I thought that's what you reviewed with Justice Stevens when you began your argument.	1
3468013	interest in the property.	1
5284010	Congress, first of all, decided to make the definition as wide as possible to use again this Court's language to cover everything that might commonly be understood to be a security, and because promoters are so ingenious, to cover all types of investments that might carry some of those characteristics.	1
9371473	Do you do you think it's...	1
147621	Nothing expressed?	1
3015957	Is this--	1
288868	How far along is that process? When is that going to be adopted?	0
9242818	And and that the Ninth Circuit felt that because this was a constitutional right that the defendant was h- had that was being withheld from the defendant because of the of the circumstances of this case, that the the district court erroneously presumed that it was prevented from going in a in a in a direction that the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go.	1
8486966	But you...	1
378166	What if I think it is?	0
14050	The --	0
4195499	Okay.	1
4935501	And you add that you can make this showing at the very outset of the order committing him to the civil treatment?	1
2312768	One other point.	1
460658	Thank you.	0
7457292	It's just as applicable to instances where the Federal tariff is specific.	1
8005743	I frankly have some difficulty with your position in the case because it is possible that as a fact finder I would not have found the facts as the court below did, and yet the court below appears to have believed one expert over another and made findings that may have been within its power to make, and how are we to upset that?	1
1470728	You don't weigh the one against the other.	1
8213199	detract...	1
1113185	Mr. Taylor, can I just ask you one question.	1
5274736	section...	1
1387257	I... I guess that one of the problems I have with... with your side of this case is that this is public information insofar as a conviction is concerned.	1
8806765	Mr. Souter's from New England.	1
3644708	How do you analyze it, really?	1
6689202	Because this is rather similar.	1
8143815	I don't understand why you ever get to this sham action and Noerr-Pennington.	1
84804	It would depend, I suppose, on how the program was structured, what the inquiry involving a compelling government...  strict scrutiny would entail.	1
1745404	[Laughter]	1
2038629	May I ask one very brief question?	1
5114406	Okay, but in answer to my question, are you taking the view that we can leave that the way it is and calculate benefits--	1
4836068	that's not the case with question one.	1
6914674	at the...	1
6772660	That...	1
25313	Well, if... if that's so, Olano's fourth prong, if you will, is that the error... asks whether the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.	1
759683	And you ha-	1
5708748	Well, why is the prime's right of little value?	1
2945172	Contained in...	1
951043	be right. An- and it might include a...	1
1885374	there're potentially...	1
4708522	This is a Wal-Mart dress.	1
1183001	Well, did he have as much of a right as a fellow passenger would have--	0
6387595	Well, how... how is it retroactive if you say it applies to work performed after the effective date?	1
6795914	Second point, with regard to Section 323(b), which is the restrictions on state parties, the corruptive potential of donations to state and local parties for use in Get Out the Vote activities directed to state and local candidate elections is again minuscule, at best attenuated, in the words of Colorado I.  But that activity, if it says go to the polls on November 8th, is swept within the definition of Federal election activity.	1
5211581	Wouldn't this have been the most controversial provision in the whole reform package, if that were so?	1
679256	Well, if there are arguable grounds for appeal, the trial lawyer would have a duty to advise of appeal rights, but the lawyer would not have a duty to actually file the appeal unless there was either a request for an appeal, nonfrivolous appeal, or there were grounds on which any reasonable attorney would pursue an appeal.	0
634397	Absolutely not, Your Honor.	0
2187215	Do you have any response to that?	1
7444180	Thank you, Your Honor.	1
588115	Well, what is the constitutional basis for your argument?	1
181446	If If...	1
6515707	I... I guess that one of the problems I have with... with your side of this case is that this is public information insofar as a conviction is concerned.	1
711092	Do you think we need to send it back for a review of standing?	0
2452354	I mean, most of the population of Massachusetts, I don't know what the situation is... we now have those maps... and yet I think it's very important to your argument, on my assumption.	1
5395351	I...	1
408308	In other words, there are...	0
4401883	so we wouldn't be in this mess?	1
843679	What we do for judicial economy is you make the decision here, now, because the Eighth Circuit would have to do the same thing.	0
7549416	But that that's...	1
660067	Well, I suppose we don't have to answer all the questions here if we were to find that the interest offset is unconstitutional because it taxes income over which California lacks jurisdiction to tax.	0
4047457	Now, what's the response to that?	1
5261736	Thank you.	1
5722262	Do your best.	1
40645	It sounds like the ALJ's description was probably... didn't get it quite right, and I take it that your opposing counsel here concedes as much.	0
631355	What are we going to do about Isaacson, remand it?	0
6699294	And you don't raise the issue of any potential jurisdiction on the basis of the Constitution alone.	1
2087602	legislators have passed.	1
1733292	Is that not--	0
4243552	And therefore, you don't get to the is he qualified question, in effect.	1
737062	There's no flood danger.	1
4757855	--But you're not arguing that the agreement precluded this.	1
2069110	And you're saying this is unconstitutional, and as a member of the association you have a right to object to it because the association has a public character.	1
973900	And what we see today is a series of sentencing schemes that have imposed greater restrictions on the sentencing judge, given them narrower options, is that correct?	0
2185508	The same method that he would use to make any other determination.	0
5223565	For instance, the use of, what is it, the cholesterol reducing drugs for memory enhancement and that sort of thing is perfectly okay, even though it's authorized only for the cholesterol?	1
957714	What if the subject matter jurisdiction issue turned on some fact finding that would take place at trial?	0
950568	Well, we don't know.	1
1569923	But that you didn't need... you didn't need any new legislation to toss that out.	1
8710591	Well, you could sue somewhere under California law?	1
282600	Well, now you're back into the merits, aren't you?	0
6854261	Is it possible that this Court could grant certiorari in one of the pending petitions and resolve the underlying issue of constitutionality of Michigan's unusual law?	1
5319846	Now, wait a minute, you think Congress was talking about damming the Mississippi River?	1
6075945	Why shouldn't it be as an objective test, do you think?	1
4116853	Well, I thought, looking at your brief, that you were asserting that the petitioner has a right to be free from compelled medication by the Government, period, per se.	1
694502	Right.	0
7574143	The witnesses were there, we're told.	1
8602228	We were assuming that the parties spending money on gun control advertising, after consulting with the candidate about that, is not a coordinated expense, so the party would be able to do it.	1
9189997	Assume for argument's sake I agree with everything you say.	1
8131204	The state denied that, did it not?	1
1384142	--Mr. Sutton, there were congressional findings that there has been discrimination against the disabled in voting, health services, transportation, education, and so on, and there are numerous examples in the legislative record, and those are areas of traditional State control.	1
3024150	It would not be testimonial.	1
9136513	I mean, you see, that's the horror.	1
2261097	And what is it here?	0
1752215	Whether the--	0
2235043	I understand.	1
4985296	Exactly.	1
255406	Is that correct?	0
3056298	But a- and...	1
5944515	--for those early years.	1
7082232	Right.	1
2481194	Could you do it under any branch of California law?	1
660978	brief.	1
5449227	Well, they...	1
8094846	cit-	1
8936026	How are these regulations based on... the ones that you say are prohibited, how are they based on health?	1
2121727	Well, we rejected...	1
714565	Is it the case that there is no market for an acre foot of water in Kansas?	1
9246575	Mr. Sutton, you have 1 minute remaining.	1
2649395	Mr. Sutton,	1
130236	We are here today because the Ninth Circuit has imposed on the State the per se rule of ineffective assistance of counsel where an attorney declines to file a notice of appeal and does not obtain a waiver of appeal...	0
6837767	Well, I thought we were considering this on the basis offered, which is the three people at 3:30 a.m. in a high crime neighborhood in a sedan where there were a certain quantity of drugs behind the armrest and money in the glove compartment.	1
3376409	Well, you don't have to say anything.	1
5809306	important that...	1
8603860	Justice O'Connor asked the question, suppose the trier of fact found 100 percent of the water, or let's say, 98 percent of the water over the last 10 years in Madera Canal has been for irrigation purposes only, any difference in the case?	1
5657772	It doesn't say it wasn't valid; it says specifically what you do.	1
8906620	And the agency could say, and we have a different rule if you're not represented.	1
8914329	I thought that's what he was saying.	1
6772701	The honorable court is now adjourned until Tuesday the twentieth of January at 10 o'clock.	1
4509642	But...	1
9362335	Oh, but as between State sovereigns, I mean, who is going to pay the bill in Colorado?	1
4739346	And the reasons are?	1
2699427	Where?	1
201524	That's why you just don't rest when the legislature says it's regulatory.	1
2154176	Is there another...	1
5475113	Was it ever challenged or was this just a common assumption?	1
292025	That claim is indifferent to either probable cause or any termination.	0
1665914	Thank you.	0
9650350	Now, is it your position that a State can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacy claims?	1
9573217	All right.	1
8849543	Well, certainly you could, but I would think there would a difference in the kind of squeezing and manipulation that would occur to identify objects within a bag than would occur normally when you just move it to make more room for your own.	1
7515142	The...  the one at page 24a, exhibit E?	1
1572526	What would be the situation if there were truly a vacant position at US Airways in customer service? Would would you think the ADA would say that it would be a reasonable accommodation to consider a disabled employee for placement in one of those...	0
2788807	What size?	1
990940	but...	1
6381832	Well, in our past Miranda cases I think the Government has taken the position that Miranda warnings are not constitutionally required.	1
495011	It shows nothing?	1
901877	In order for the driver to be continued to be detained, there must be new justification or consent, which you did not get in this case; but you must let the driver go because you are acting in, you are finished with the traffic stop, you are finished with the reason that he was detained in the first place, the purpose: Going across the fog line.	0
788727	very...	1
148210	And say it is unexhausted and... and the... a Federal statute of limitations hasn't run.	1
4631719	I don't see why you would be so limited necessarily.	1
6359519	And in order to make your opponent's point here, it would have to be a new case.	1
4897865	Quite right.	1
2173639	the act.	0
3129544	things that you...	1
9080665	service jobs, once a quarter, are all declared open?	1
5954115	I wouldn't think that.	1
8898488	You want us to look at the videotape?	1
1049367	Assuming they are the same--	1
8984875	that...	1
1173089	Well, it doesn't coerce the contractor to withhold money?	1
737708	It is...  it is derivatively obtained information.	1
7091174	What...	1
1576987	--I think that--	0
7064492	Do you--	1
1791956	But then you have that very same stop where the officer gives the ticket first and then adds a minute for a dog sniff--	0
8576564	I... I understand that some of them do.	1
1371493	Well, you say it's settled.	1
5192922	May I ask...	1
5573944	Well, the water's left the Federal project in this case, too.	1
1576659	Your Honor.	1
3094172	[Inaudible]	1
1888964	I would think Darden would be the first place we'd look.	1
9649729	the so-called parallelism with section nineteen eighty-three actions.	1
5268102	And what would that dollar amount be here?	1
254426	And we're dealing here with only some of those counts?	0
1976004	Could... could you refer to something?	1
4919313	The compelling interest that applied to the 1st District did not apply to the 12th District.	1
4524309	was...	1
2927752	Okay.	1
874792	I mean, what's going on?	1
4416168	That's what I'm asking, which which?	1
240211	Now, you want us to apply a presumption that a petition is timely if it's filed within 60 days.	0
1358127	That's as good as we could do.	0
1871977	Now, could the Government not have sought review either under the collateral order doctrine at that time, or even by mandamus to address directly whether the statute is constitutional?	0
772735	What does the fact that it's boiler plate language have anything to do with it?	1
3305498	or --	1
3590550	In thi- -- how come...	1
2021061	Well, this is the precise time when the party ought to be able to make its own selection for the spokesperson to run in the general election, to articulate the stand and the views that the party wants the voters to have a chance to hear.	0
936654	Well, doesn't... doesn't the statute basically leave it to the commissioner to... to evaluate whether a representative payee is acting in the best interest of the child?	1
1818228	And I suppose that depends on how we define functionality, in a sense.	0
3411206	These people weren't being paid for doing piecework.	1
1355170	The other point that I think is very, very important with respect to that, if the state starts to distinguishing between discussion of a subject and proselytizing, the entanglement problem is going to be enormous.	1
9041279	detract...	1
5521539	Mr. Everett, we'll hear from you.	1
4372558	No problem.	1
3228376	Or even you don't suspect.	1
6205332	I wouldn't think so.	1
341405	Well, we hope that if you look at officers' diligence there are things that will help enforce that.	0
4041258	And this was... and then this in effect at the time the crime was committed, this general power in the State to extend.	1
7311205	Right?	1
6598480	Your Honor- I'm sorry.	1
155032	Would you be here--	0
6394370	The Court acknowledged that in the Reves case, said that there...  there are...  there are situations that look more like consumer transactions or they may look...  more look like...	1
1668021	--You expand the mission, Your Honor, for everything that comes within the tasks that are part of the traffic stop.	0
1980742	But turning to this case, when at the outset a determination is made for an order for a civil commitment, is there no basis for the court to determine and to look at how the disease is defined, how the treatment is defined, what treatment facilities are available in order to determine whether or not it's punitive?	1
2279043	At the end of the day, what happened?	0
121078	--where do we get that?	0
9446288	[Laughter]	1
8330411	then the statute would not apply?	1
6131284	Yes, it did, Your Honor.	1
2783241	With respect to the 1st, which was even more racially dominated, as I understand it, than the 12th, the court said that's okay, but not with respect to the 12th.	1
7967728	of proof.	1
3558681	I want a criterion for why she drew the line at 0.8.	1
3744285	I I I I don't know f- f-	1
7334339	--That's not... that's not part of the record here, is it?	1
5058388	attribution.	1
5745233	interest in the property.	1
9100100	Thank you, Mr. McCormick.	1
4464236	Very well, Mr. Roberts.	1
2455195	That was a prayer.	1
1862830	Then the answer to Justice Stevens, if I have the right standard, would be yes, because Congress did intend the Federal cause of action to be an exclusive substitute for those State actions which allege that 3 percent is usurious.	1
8906576	So at least as to those women I don't see a protective purpose.	1
166945	Don't you think this Court would have the power of review and to issue rulings on what the law is so that it would be uniform?	0
6324100	There is a law taxing table games at... the revenues from that, at 20 percent.	1
419634	determination.	1
7017067	that employers can't...	1
359503	Well, even in areas where it's already against the law to have materials that are obscene or harmful to minors?	0
1860686	which to...	0
540132	Well, except Gwaltney didn't really get into the circumstances expressly, and I guess Steel Co. did, so we have to reconcile that in some way.	1
1597757	And if not, why not?	0
8567116	Suppose this scheme, the Alaska scheme, did allow people... like the parties here... to say, I'm no longer dangerous.	1
4852344	And if I have someone who owes me under a contract, I have a valid contract claim against somebody, the State can take that away, and they have taken away property?	1
9021064	At page 49 and 50 it says, the withholding was adequately pleaded and proven, but I'm not sure that you say that you had complied with the statue.	1
2420660	But our remedy would not be to...	1
4667346	The early statutes?	1
8341543	properly, sir.	1
6838359	Well, I'm not saying that...	1
261853	They certainly don't apply retroactively, but what constitutes a retroactive application of them is another question, and I don't consider it a retroactive application of them to say that they apply to all cases that seek an appeal after the enactment insofar as their provisions governing appeals are concerned.	1
7804476	No.	1
773451	Well, I suppose we'd have to decide here not only whether it was per se invalid, but whether it was reasonable under any other standard.	1
1226457	All right.	1
2026461	of choices.	1
8048203	And was that...	1
6850968	These are all cases she won or lost?	1
1736115	May I--	0
6758798	But the courts made up those forms, no?	1
7736318	Does it have authority to...  to make that requirement for cities within its jurisdiction?	1
2998837	go through the collection process.	1
3306570	So Justice Ginsburg, in response to your question, the courts of appeals are faced with the same array of options whether this Court adopts a procedural default principle or not, and in the Ninth Circuit, for example, in 2001, the Court faced roughly on the order of 50 direct appeals in which ineffective assistance of counsel was asserted as a basis for relief, and in 10 of those cases, the Court was able to decide conclusively that the claim was lacking in merit and therefore couldn't be brought again under 2255, and--	1
5500945	why restaurants -- every employer should hire...	1
7375475	Well,	1
8300073	In fact, they rejected them.	1
6103186	why restaurants -- every employer should hire...	1
3595360	therefore constitutional...	1
4719434	But is it a...  it is the type of scheme transaction in which people invest their money on...  for those types of purposes, and...  and in...  where...  where there are difficulties at the margin, this Court and the SEC have provided a formula by which these various different factors can be examined as in the Reves case.	1
477755	So that...	0
6351062	[Inaudible]	1
1497472	Just on this whole issue, you're arguing that this might be in Tribal Court.	1
495778	It isn't?	1
494985	But in this context, perhaps we should not import public forum analysis.	0
1265940	Congress, first of all, decided to make the definition as wide as possible to use again this Court's language to cover everything that might commonly be understood to be a security, and because promoters are so ingenious, to cover all types of investments that might carry some of those characteristics.	1
3273196	vary.	1
2047325	is in our joint appendix Your -- oh, no, no, it's in the petition.	1
4599081	--That's right, broader.	1
7054763	the litigation in the court of appeals.	1
806937	No, but would your argument lead you to conclude that maybe that scheme that's been there for 25 years is invalid?	1
1706088	And it wasn't clearly done here.	0
2118530	Now, I guess the California Supreme Court hasn't really weighed in on this question and the Ninth Circuit seems to have relied on some court of appeals decisions in making its decision about standing.	0
1823015	encourage it.	1
1673670	Well, we can't... what about the Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer decision, where the Court unanimously found Title VII was a valid abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment immunity, and there was no inquiry into the history of gender discrimination, it was just accepted?	1
3362701	certainly up front...	1
121750	Is there some tension between the knew or should have known in '69, and the no undue delay for a lawsuit that wasn't filed for 17 years?	1
608380	Wouldn't an arrest have been more intrusive?	1
6303161	53.	1
515083	What details?	1
6356557	Is that your answer?	1
248471	Let's put it that way.	0
1724241	Well, I don't I I'm not sure either.	1
281221	Well, they certainly differed on a key element.	0
2345746	If If...	1
3176852	Ms. O'Connor?	1
1660955	These are -- these are -- these complaints fall under the rubric of custody.	0
1038836	So you want us to say something else here.	0
5633546	Could you have sued the prime alleging that you had fully complied and had paid required wages in... under any provision of California law?	1
7849434	It doesn't surprise me that Congress would not be terribly upset by this restriction.	1
3325957	Honor s-	1
4120443	What's the test for State action, in your view?	1
6606087	[Laughter]	1
524689	--articulated test?	0
1031522	Thank you, Justice Ginsburg.	0
5898290	You... all you have to do is file a motion under this PLRA and say, we file a motion to terminate the ongoing relief.	1
813838	--adjudicating the correctness of the application of rules for wholesale rates that are contained of thousands or millions of words filed before the Federal Power Commission.	1
6536443	Well, just to make sure... I think this was Justice Breyer's hypothetical.	1
9239290	There were exceptions in Ray.	1
978834	Well, let me -- in this case, after the -- after the defendant was acquitted in this case, he had two years and three months to file this action in a timely manner, embracing both of the claims. So the idea that because you're using the traditional accrual rule, that you're -- you're putting the defendant's back against the wall as a practical matter is not true.	0
567905	--I think that's right, but as other members of the Court have suggested, once there's probable cause to stop someone for--	0
5698721	when the employer is paying it out of one...	1
5030930	And so I assume you may want to address the other arguments in the case.	1
8195899	You can only...	1
2625598	[Laughter]	1
3352979	You say, if I understand your case, you wouldn't take a position that flood waters are never... you're not going to try to prove that flood waters were never released through this canal, but you would say categorically that the canal itself, when constructed, had no flood control purpose.	1
2383445	It was a-	1
815470	Now, that issue is extremely important, but is something that I don't think can be done today.	0
924284	It goes to a jury.	1
2158961	Okay.	0
4105798	How do you analyze it, really?	1
4590384	has...	1
5882172	Do you concede that--	1
304754	So, has he used the house in... in the sense contemplated by the statute?	0
967196	Was probation a possibility?	1
8265072	One of those problems might be the existence of records for the purpose to apply this apportionment rule.	1
1393590	It could also apply just an- and sixty-two oh five is not specific to restaurants or food or beverage establishments or or tips at all, because another common error that employers can sometimes make is mis-characterizing a worker as an independent contractor, for example, and upon determining later that the person is actually an employee and they should be withholding...	0
1646880	We have --	0
8331921	What... what if the State simply decided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way that Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had criminal convictions of any sort without any more information in... in the last 5 years?	1
1699559	But my question is about maps--	1
7914806	Mostly facial.	1
7408966	Not necessarily, Justice Kennedy.	1
2170750	Was that ever challenged at trial?	1
807155	Your answer is yes.	1
3681369	the court of appeals...	1
1053509	There was some cross examination.	0
95837	No.	0
3984355	May I ask you a question about that?	1
7236856	Why would it not be wiser for us to say, just to keep the systems running smoothly, look, we are not going to be bound by State court determinations of legislative intent or purpose?	1
8802714	Except it does if you're... if you're right on your theory.	1
9419564	And I guess the jury verdict covered both.	1
6523002	Is this a case where it would meet the standard for granting leave to appeal?	1
2819990	There must have been some procedure that you were availing yourself of under State law and State court.	1
925096	Well, in -- in the Second Circuit, the prudential stay has been in use for decades with no -- no untoward results. And --	0
658208	Suppose the shoe were on the other foot, and Colorado was suing some other State?	1
8054152	[Laughter]	1
71750	That doesn't say, talk about health.	1
989252	I was just saying that.	1
8502100	--Let's assume Congress said that and meant that completely.	1
1226030	I mean, what... what is the jury to make of that?	0
4067649	--Do... do--	1
418554	Well, isn't that an Establishment Clause issue?	0
1258037	Yes.	0
7231690	It could be part of the settlement deal.	1
9125759	Polidoro.	1
4840052	inmates...	1
2232489	Does section 9 mean exactly the same thing that 10 and 11 mean, in effect, in the use of the word may?	0
7257166	I mean, at that...	1
8033395	But that is not...	1
8875952	Well, presumably you could question supervisory employees who prepare payroll records and ask them how much have you paid these people, if anything.	1
6464900	In order to find in your favor, do you think we need to overrule those cases here?	1
1551555	I thought you just said that was your position with reference to the parochial schools.	1
1709076	But under--	0
6816664	Would that change the case?	1
2979658	Your brief reads to me... at about page 15... to suggest that you're proposing a broad rule that probable cause exists to arrest all occupants of a car anytime commercial quantities of narcotics are found in the passenger portion of the car.	1
1291035	Does that distinguish this Erie ordinance from Barnes?	0
8195780	And... and section 113(f) says, any person may seek contribution from any other person during or following any civil action under 106 or 107(a).	1
6468785	Is the effects test used to impeach the finding that the legislature had a regulatory intent?	1
6775909	Yeah.	1
1043172	A fall-back provision.	1
3525841	I would think you would win under an objective test.	1
4228436	That's...	1
1971419	So are you here to say if Washington State's legislature said that for a burglary conviction that a judge can sentence anywhere from 10 to 20 years.	0
2133952	Why could there be a difference between the two?	1
5798183	I... one of the briefs does, the City of Boston, includes in its prohibition against discrimination ex-convicts.	1
7629101	--That's right, broader.	1
8317276	We had been.	1
504088	twenty-one Q in particular.	1
2463115	But they still recognized... the FEC has still recognized that the national parties are, in fact, national parties, not Federal parties, and therefore, they can spend 35 percent on allocable activities, even in a Federal election year as in 2000 when the RNC gave $5.6 million of non-Federal money to state and local candidates.	1
8822374	vast...	1
4382606	--where you destroy huge areas of the surface?	1
5506287	Mr. Phillips, you have 2 minutes remaining.	1
1907184	Could you do it under any branch of California law?	1
1633636	What about a dog sniff, how about a dog sniff?	0
8747036	But...	1
4388429	Your Honor, because...	1
9346217	been pretty much abandoned.	1
2015261	Isn't there then a limit on what the party can give him?	1
6874033	I thought we aired this with Justice Stevens at the outset, and yet we're getting bogged down in consent, and I just want to know where we are.	1
2836229	--haven't either.	1
1447344	In fact, that's the most common sense reading of it I would think.	1
5002879	--Yes, I think we'll wait just a minute until some of the crowd clears out.	1
525361	Is that... on what theory?	1
9135065	No.	1
4211785	We do...	1
2055249	And one line you could draw with this statute that wouldn't pose a retroactivity problem, I assume, would be to say that work performed by the lawyer after the effective date is governed by the provisions of the PLRA.	0
2287147	If you're really interested in why the legislature did it, you ought to get affidavits from every legislator saying this is why I voted for it, and if 51 percent voted for it for a certain reason, that was the reason.	1
9305483	Could the State Board of Education, if it so chose, say we're no longer going to rely in any sense upon this organization, and we ourselves will set the rules for intramural contests?	1
1587836	--where you destroy huge areas of the surface?	1
1819710	And sometimes if the safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great, I understood at least, that could affect the decisions.	1
7065964	Mr. Hurd, I... there's one part of the statute that may be troublesome, and that is the prima facie evidence provision.	1
2482315	enforce it, but it literally covers them, doesn't it?	1
7286055	It was a-	1
9585199	And that goes for the smokeless tobacco and cigars as well?	1
2658484	Who cares?	1
9669383	I mean, California wouldn't have to do it this way.	1
7309278	323(a) prohibits the solicitation, receipt, direction, transfer and spending.	1
1856179	Not even a typewritten name, because in the first part of your argument you say you don't need the signature, so if I apply that to your second part of the argument... we have appeals, we don't know who has appealed.	1
9600693	And the elements are who is appealing, and what else?	1
5606292	And now when I look at the district judge's opinion, one of his points, one of them was not just the war of experts.	1
6930340	No, okay.	1
5296543	Isn't that right?	1
9625027	I think...	1
5419442	back to...	1
1689521	dollars of taxes of the husband.	1
512330	I mean, that's why it placed the jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.	0
701566	to State law...	1
3789477	wanting...	1
1958341	But, the standard forum selection clause?	1
8223549	Mr. Waxman, do you concede that EPA can consider countervailing health concerns, for example, the skin cancer problem?	1
2256502	Mister...	0
568513	You don't want us to redetermine the facts, do you?	0
5002716	You don't know that?	1
7849772	And let me ask you, is it often that roadblocks are set up just to get information like this?	1
7407	I I mean, there is a provision in the act itself, is there not, that speaks to a vacancy and and that can be a a reasonable accommodation?	0
9502410	I would suggest...	1
89917	Federal law, and as a policy matter we generally look to State law? But isn't that itself a question of Federal law, the extent to which we're going to look to State law?	1
1178659	Well, I suppose we don't have to answer all the questions here if we were to find that the interest offset is unconstitutional because it taxes income over which California lacks jurisdiction to tax.	0
569755	Was that addressed?	0
212709	--Oh, yes, sir, I do.	0
3562493	what...	1
2699205	[Inaudible]	1
64464	But it is odd, because your approach basically tells us, well, the APA just sets a minimum standard, and any other standard that's more, well, then that applies.	0
1457776	Those are things, Your Honor, that have been accepted as part of--	0
991898	I was... I was saying but the requirement of the statute is that for the rest of your life you have to take affirmative steps to... to re-register--	1
2893171	after the comment because...	1
4734550	And you say that's yours.	1
8994908	Suppose all of the schools in the association were public schools.	1
1726377	It's kind of a loaded question, Judge, I think.	0
130851	here.	1
1342544	Yes.	0
2228757	Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:	0
6710319	So it's a little hard to look for congressional intent.	1
3297510	In some respects, it's... looks regulatory.	1
7819542	court found...	1
6696657	[Laughter]	1
5922178	thing about...	1
2241758	Would it? That wouldn't make any sense.	0
5688775	That's the que- the basic question isn't it?	1
2092197	But on the test.	0
2364260	So for instance, a stop might reasonably take longer if there are more people in the car so that the officer has to check the the criminal histories of more people in the car.	0
2974034	--The rational basis is the Republicans have a majority in the State legislature.	1
4017821	Uh-huh.	1
3703690	long...	1
682202	[Laughter]	1
4173231	That is beyond the 180 days.	1
2168739	Well, now now you've made...	1
2121355	That is, suppose somebody is a pickpocket and you have a list and say, pickpockets have to register, the same thing as here.	1
3627561	[Laughter]	1
7856925	Well, why isn't the compact on the same level as a Federal statute?	1
6532413	Because of the error in scoring?	1
1455298	In fact, in your brief in opposition you said, although probable cause existed, and the police, so forth, so on.	1
9495733	Is there a Tribal Court?	1
198025	There would be a duty to advise...	0
811230	It was a state court matter.	0
7329814	That's what he did here.	1
3970163	Mr. Bell, wouldn't that be, wouldn't that be...	1
621106	that they had amended it...	1
6293720	I'm just wondering what you think we should do.	1
6731344	Okay, and that was a... that really stretched the statute, didn't it?	1
2279775	But you don't mean it's easily... it's not--	0
3822997	Because the --	1
25546	Well, isn't there some room, though, for the argument that it... there may be a business necessity not to hire somebody who's going to be killed as a result?	0
1824822	back to...	1
2568015	--Well, at least--	1
4969519	Now, what's the answer to that argument?	1
5465452	It might be useful to say they were wrong in--	1
1474289	We're not trying to make that argument.	0
4283722	In US versus Agurs, the Court said the prosecutor will not have violated his constitutional duty unless his omission is of sufficient significance to result in the denial of a fair trial.	1
356897	That's correct, Your Honor, and...	0
1969755	Well, the court had three different opportunities to take up Mr. Fiore's case presumably.	0
5141225	That could be, Your Honor.	1
8415094	Not not be --	1
8329714	Well, I really thought the train left the station in Pilot Life.	1
8301586	[Laughter]	1
8680663	Isn't there some initial assessment that must be made?	1
3362933	Does it correctly state the law?	1
5644946	Thank you, Ms. Underwood.	1
9293335	They can...	1
3572619	But it seems to me that what you're doing is combining the analysis of whether there is a deprivation of a property interest with the analysis of whether there is an adequate State process for asserting it, and you have said, I guess your third point is, there is an adequate State process and therefore there has been no denial of due process in this situation.	1
1476787	But we really haven't equated section 2 challenges with section 5 challenges.	0
8566903	Some of the amici take that position, do they not?	1
5079080	To paraphrase the Court in National Conservative PAC, we are not here quibbling about fine-tuning prophylactic measures.	1
349463	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
7522449	None which require affirmative steps.	1
6840912	Contained in...	1
1935703	And it's hard to know from your argument the answer to that.	0
130568	And the reason that...	1
8209475	I would think that the problem is what happens to that information later, that everybody in the neighborhood knows it, that they're likely to shun the people, that... that it may be too broad.	1
1483447	The specific question in this case is whether Officer Struble was entitled to piggyback an already completed traffic offense with probable cause on to that piggyback -- on to that traffic offense for an investigation of Mr. Rodriguez involving nothing more than a hunch.	0
1930008	Well, that's what I want to know, is, in light of the Government's position and the way this case was resolved, how does that fit, and what does it do to, that so-called safe-harbor provision?	0
8277435	Oh, I thought we were talking about this case.	1
64776	Well, yes, but is it... is it the case that most courts are holding, under the scheme I described, that not only while the court is deciding it, but the time allowed to enable them to go to the next higher court is excluded as well?	0
130098	Well, it was filed before a responsive pleading--	0
2101857	Also, the probation officer stated in the probation report that he would get 15 years to life.	0
8025867	charge. They kept...	1
7941912	There's no objection.	1
8104958	That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.	1
3295701	It see- it it it I think the answer to that latter point with respect to the individual consideration is covered by the fact that this particular program, under the circumstances of this district, are i- they may be it may be frequently occurring, but it's individualistic in the sense that entering into this program alleviates a substantial amount of work and and and provides a substantial benefit to the prosecutor in that district without which the prosecutor may not be able to enforce the law on all of the responsibilities of the law.	1
3620925	enforce it, but it literally covers them, doesn't it?	1
9162966	For example, if you say, from the day of entry of judgment in one section of the statute, and in another section of the statute it reads, from the day judgment was entered, do you really think you have to give different meaning to those two formulations?	1
4498048	should...	1
3009140	It looks as that finding is a finding that's based on the very thing we said not to use... registration.	1
8017602	Let the judge do it?	1
2910094	Shouldn't--	1
8444886	I... I thought that it was an additional step that you had to take if you... even if you find the legislature had the... the permitted intent.	1
3623378	They didn't have to let you have the slot machines.	1
121784	We don't have a suit for a couple of decades, and interest is piling up.	1
9049965	How about coal and how about copper--	1
9057241	Well, just on this point--	1
113819	Now, after the trial court resolved it and denied relief, then there's no review mechanism other than filing an original writ with the court of appeals?	0
6579862	says that...	1
2110159	Not 1338?	0
9277586	And on question two, if I understand you correctly, there is substantial agreement in the courts of appeals that you're correct?	1
168333	The students get some credit for physical education, toward that requirement, from being on this varsity team?	1
6810106	proving...	1
7556116	Well, but there is a... there is a question of law involved as to whether there's a liberty interest.	1
5525240	Apparently, it does not perceive it as a total benefit?	1
4368173	Very well, Ms. Zinn.	1
3794480	decision.	1
7657522	But the consequence of trying to make the local parties independent of each other is that those 58 California parties cannot pool their resources for a statewide Get Out the Vote program, Justice Breyer.	1
4322594	litigation where...	1
1712394	Yes.	0
8406175	But that's the Ninth Circuit test, in effect.	1
5498473	That's the opposite theory one way, it's very simple case that way.	1
5494452	On the other hand, if your position is right, then this association, where most of the members are public school principals, can decide as far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, we don't want to have any teams for girls.	1
437746	--from the evidence?	0
3306807	General Olson, we'll hear from you.	1
8565854	Did the judge say it was simply beyond his authority to alter these three special issues?	1
3808448	Yes.	1
3119657	Well, that's right.	1
2942786	indictment and...	1
9265554	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.	1
7078811	I know that the Torres establishes law, but I don't know that any of the others say that you can't cure a defect.	1
975592	Was what?	0
1115485	Okay.	0
554026	Well, we're not talking about job elimination.	0
199662	With respect to working --	1
1664639	[Laughter]	1
1670184	Well, now you're back into the merits, aren't you?	0
6410897	That's...	1
5331350	And do the statistics also tell us how often under a Wende procedure the courts would actually find arguable issues on their review and send it back?	1
1355108	should...	1
263367	In the Sandin case in 1995, this Court said that prisoners have a State-created liberty interest only where the deprivation or restraint imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.	1
7649312	So that this rule, to the extent that it requires a full-time employee, does apply to private schools as well.	1
2022966	He seemed to be saying the Federal Government does make these determinations, and you seem to be saying they just make a blanket determination and we don't want them to make individual determinations.	0
9061837	Well, the other most troublesome point for me, anyway, is this Court's decision in Allied Bruce, which dealt with section 2, and said that we're going to interpret it now as reaching the full scope of Congress' Commerce Clause power.	1
4145256	All right.	1
8271443	because of the reassignment.	1
2126972	May I just...	0
635858	Thank you.	0
987374	Is that a problem?	0
368349	If the time were reasonable, that might be a different picture, but isn't that kind of burdensome?	0
2398236	Would the Government be without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?	0
549775	The whole thing?	0
7167915	I suppose the most likely scenario for significant contribution would be the notion that I will give this money, and expect in return that if and when I ever call this particular official, if the official is elected, they'll pay attention to me.	1
5194924	I mean, you're going to... yes.	1
5167692	What are the things in Missouri that are deemed relevant?	1
1587340	[Laughter]	1
7409422	Well, it didn't expressly.	1

4609734	But they...	1
8599673	Who instructs principals?	1
490130	But you don't take that position.	0
3699894	I agree with you on that, but I now suffer from Justice Scalia's question.	1
5886272	Because it is a...  it is...	1
226519	you...	1
5885318	And this is just a regulatory scheme to... to make that information more clear as to how many people are in the community have suffered that conviction.	1
4662365	the individual employees. And...	1
6582384	For income tax purposes, nowadays it's '94 income, is that right?	1
721340	Well, that's simply the Warden's position, that there are no arguable grounds.	0
7775507	Do you agree?	1
1952713	Now, if we adopt your position, I think I would agree with Justice Kennedy's implication.	1
989383	If black acre has coal in the hard form, and it's right next to white acre, and white acre does not have any coal in extractable solid form, and you drill on white acre, and you begin draining gas from the adjacent coal field, are you in white acre?	1
5503227	You're claiming a constitutional right, as is usual in habeas cases, so I thought you were saying in the second part of your argument that it doesn't make any difference.	1
1873831	We're not talking about the Fourth Amendment and the officers and open season on the officers and what the officers can do.	0
9601810	--he's not going to be able to make exactly the same claim later in 2255.	1
4355003	Well now, what difference does adult sponsored make?	1
4244869	Did you ever ask the prosecution whether Farr was an informant?	1
550954	and how would we value...	1
3061023	But I still don't see how that means that this one sentence is so controlling that all the other evidence of future dangerousness can't be looked at to decide whether it was harmless error.	1
460987	And we've given a lot of discretion in prison administration.	1
2114213	--Oh, yes, sir, I do.	0
1823169	--I don't see any other factor, unless you show that finality has a normal meaning, which... so that the earlier provision is giving it some peculiar meaning.	1
858126	Well, you can't square that with the Near case at all.	1
5803924	The contracts that we're talking about.	1
5114905	Well, but now this... the funds administered, as I understand it, also include tax dollars appropriated by the Hawaii legislature.	1
7516122	Excuse me.	1
2171651	I think it's all right when it seems to work the other way.	1
1936344	What are we dealing with here?	0
1433110	Propeller guard?	0
5949852	portray par-	1
8340532	Was the Shasta Dam funded and constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation?	1
8364739	Well, what kind of a line should we draw then?	1
343182	Is that what's happening?	0
8713262	Does Workman's Comp go up if... if he suffers?	1
2301955	Suppose in the hypothetical case, where Massachusetts bans all advertising at any location of all cigarettes, it recites, because of our concerns with health, all advertising of cigarettes is banned in the State of Massachusetts, would that be preempted?	1
5719068	If the state committee is using Levin money, they can accept no transfers.	1
8247693	I mean, we're talking about 332, but it's a big, complicated act.	1
716966	Then they had a more specific provision dealing with ozone which said, this is going to be the standard.	1
9030590	There must have been some procedure that you were availing yourself of under State law and State court.	1
5785929	You... and... and your business did not apply for that.	1
3076661	At least you're not arguing from that.	1
8826862	Let the judge do it?	1
255957	Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.	1
1081780	If there are no further questions, I will request the remaining for rebuttal.	0
3055629	Concept.	1
9235104	No, what I was driving at is suppose that this statute too is... I... suppose I were to believe it was excessive in light of its purpose in respect to some... some people, but not to others.	1
8647795	And so Congress probably didn't have in mind that its jurisdiction was as broad as we would have subsequently indicated, and apparently it intended at least that the act not include or cover contracts of employment over which their authority to regulate was very clear, right?	1
3581967	Even without exigent circumstances you think that he could have made the exclusion from the house?	1
8482922	The... the trust itself has to provide the means, the... the financial wherewithal to make those repairs.	1
9616221	And it's not a brief of yours, and by what authority did you file it, if I may ask?	1
8376804	Thank you.	1
6780671	and on this...	1
1715795	I I don't think that that's correct, what...	0
954478	--Well, would you answer the same question I asked Mr. Wallace.	0
4312800	Well, would you concede that the Friant dam has a substantial flood control purpose?	1
2350433	And I just wonder whether that's valid.	0
8220607	fifty-eight A thirty-one twenty is where thirty-one twenty-one Q appears, and remember that is a section that provides definitions.	1
1419842	Is that right?	0
5618074	"--But under this statute, with the safe-harbor provision in it, is it unlawful for her, as a lawyer, to say, ""You can destroy these documents""?"	1
8360996	[Laughter]	1
7338603	Your Honor.	1
4475567	These petitioners are not part of the agreement?	1
8064634	And one wonders why the Government wants to take such a... an extreme position even though it lawfully could.	1
5113889	provisions,	1
218300	Well--	0
1965511	from an American, US perspective under the statute, citizens are subjects, and the fact that it is a corporation formed in the British Virgin Islands would lead me to conclude that is a subject of a foreign nation under our own statute.	1
1038894	How do we know?	0
4568448	It's not a continuance.	1
7199766	Then, the answer is, is it not... it isn't a severely specific waiver.	1
7945665	--and additionally, it varies significantly by locality, depending on the particular rules that are in place for replacement of counsel on appeal.	1
3865196	But we know from Colorado I that not all activities of political parties are coordinated with their candidates and we know from the current regime, from the regime that has been in effect for more than a decade, that all donations to political parties, Federal money, non-Federal money or anything else, is fully disclosed and reported.	1
4837001	Is that your basic position?	1
1626835	Is this anything that the State couldn't undertake to do itself with its State driver's license and so forth?	0
4123529	Okay.	1
156811	The State is saying, you give us the money that you owe to the sub.	1
1305031	hear that in response to the question.	0
685827	These are just like... there are... all rules and regulations they pronounce after... if you prevail will be State rules.	1
7903822	Okay.	1
1533056	Yes.	0
9662466	So if you're in the State, and whether you say it was a procedural violation or a substantive violation, I... as long as the focus of 2253(c) is on the State criminal process, what went wrong there, then all you have is constitutional objectives.	1
1559502	--Well, would you answer the same question I asked Mr. Wallace.	0
6225801	I mean, what--	1
6713265	Here, because there's no give, it does have a punitive feel.	1
1196134	Would this clause have sufficed to waive state sovereign immunity for Eleventh Amendment purposes if it were state instead of a tribe?	1
2130900	--may I ask you about another provision, Section 1515(c)?	0
743773	No.	0
6083630	--I assume that because you're here--	1
1970377	If I could turn just for one moment to the application of a procedural default rule to the facts of this case, in... if the procedural default rule were to be applied, the question at the time of collateral review is whether... is whether the defendant has introduced extrinsic evidence not available in the trial record in support of this claim of ineffectiveness, and the court of appeals in this case found that there was no extrinsic evidence material to the claim of ineffectiveness introduced in the affidavits on which the petitioner relies because the affidavits suggests avenues of inquiry the trial counsel could have pursued that trial counsel in fact did pursue.	1
9633743	Because as I understood it, the criticism was that he concentrated only on the fringe districts and not the core, but I thought it was the fringe districts that were the problem here.	1
326800	no.	1
8803417	--and... and upset what's going on all across the country?	1
1697533	Well, we're talking here about fruits, the location of the gun and the gun.	1
6617051	Now, what should we do about that?	1
7242163	Why wouldn't required embrace the common law as well as... I don't see any difference.	1
1132632	That's fine.	0
479902	Well, let's talk about that because I think we've injected you into this whole issue that you've been talking about after the... the petition was filed.	1
757422	Right?	0
4005155	Massachusetts says, in the State of Massachusetts you cannot advertise cigarettes anywhere, on any billboard, or on any store sign.	1
7458998	Now, was there an adjudication whether these wages had been paid or not?	1
581302	Why could there be a difference between the two?	1
7478287	It's very helpful to have the facts developed in the State courts, and I wondered whether that wasn't what Congress was trying to impose here, some kind of exhaustion requirement.	1
2171480	Under the Levin amendment, it is illegal for the national parties to send even a Federal dollar to a state or local party in order to, in order to participate in a, in a joint Get Out the Vote program that the state is funding in part with Levin.	1
1528237	Have we ever said that plain error would preserve this, in the civil context?	1
709980	Based on the judge's discretion, that's perfectly okay.	0
1874457	Yes.	1
6166260	under Michael Williams versus...	1
9629355	businesses.	1
1354788	And we would then have to consider... what +/?	0
96759	evidence...	1
7386347	Are you now summarizing article, section (d), Mr. Robbins?	1
2193443	Is it true that in-State producers of raw milk are guaranteed a minimum price for their milk under the California scheme, but out-of-State producers are not?	1
5046590	"""If you find there any mitigating circumstances in this case. """	1
3167651	If that is preempted, then suppose they say, it has to be blank, the ad, blank.	1
2651551	Is that fair?	1
6581685	Do you have any response to that?	1
202083	pattern is.	1
1406602	The... the trust itself has to provide the means, the... the financial wherewithal to make those repairs.	1
2794251	Let's assume they don't.	1
2201122	Which she doesn't have to say.	1
6400062	Why isn't it a sensible distinction to draw?	1
4049896	Well, you know, that's why we grant certiorari in cases, because we don't think one... one rule should be... obtained in New York and another rule in New Orleans, but I don't think we ever thought it was the Equal Protection Clause that--	1
1041789	Well, we...	1
937452	What more, on your view, does the new section, does the new preemption section preempt?	1
7884911	the case.	1
783554	--that phrase in section 1422.	1
2492742	Isn't that right?	1
4886017	No and I'm not...	1
8455822	provision that I asked you about was made in nineteen ninety-eight, so that was well after the beginning of aggregate assessments.	1
6318527	Bivens should be extended is a separate question.	1
5517811	Has the Government taken a different position on the testimonial aspect in the past?	1
7395950	purposes.	1
4913483	Sure, but that's prophylactic, too, I suppose.	1
8791094	No, by now we're in the federal district court.	1
4280320	On what basis?	1
1651776	That seems like tilting the securities laws completely on their head.	1
8384755	And so certainly, so far as our remand order is concerned, the Supreme Court of Iowa is free to do whatever it wants so long as not... as it's not inconsistent with our opinion.	1
7242897	disciplinary actions...	1
7866026	I must say...	1
3026978	I mean, it's rather crucial to your case.	1
3097466	They don't need to distinguish between coordinated and uncoordinated if that's what they're concerned with?	1
600080	And are you're saying that a legislature can always defend a racial gerrymander post hoc by saying that it accords with partisan voting patterns?	1
4660847	And you don't prevent them from...	1
979191	There was a 20 percent rate across everything, all the kinds of games that they have on the riverboat.	1
2764722	I didn't think it was presented to us on that basis.	1
2946260	Is... is that just a rule of the patrolmen in the State?	1
2594273	to the institutionalized spouse.	1
8779168	But then what do you do?	1
5166021	[Laughter]	1
5360908	because of...	1
8220771	Now, that's where I... it says you can't have a regulation based on smoking and health and I'm beginning, naively, to think, if this isn't based on smoking and health, what is, and so therefore, however I might feel about it, that's what the language says.	1
36834	--be a QDRO, though?	1
3190746	Does it matter how... how much you have to take apart of a car to make a search?	1
16468	Now, the Federal court under your view presumably would have to say, no, it's still pending in the State court.	1
4901841	I don't see how you can draw that distinction at all.	1
6666767	at that time.	1
2118114	What... what is the general rule in other States that are unlike California that say you go for post-conviction relief first to the trial court?	0
2150378	--Congress wanted to, so it's opposite Chevron.	1
1250485	Well, the record doesn't tell us, but it's just incredible to me that the principal would not be accountable to the Board of Education for the principal's actions in voting.	1
2333857	It says that the board may authorize the manual recount, it doesn't require it.	1
8008733	based on the alleged...	1
8700626	--that's at issue?	1
1739550	Well, it's a 12-week period.	1
479895	Well--	0
432071	"Is that what would be applied if we had to address the consequence here, of holding it to be a ""weighing"" State?"	0
8809867	I thought--	1
7243124	part of this...	1
4611338	And for us, the real purpose counts, not the conceivable purpose.	1
2236300	[Laughter]	1
7706778	Is the fact that this qui tam relator entitled to some portion of the recovery at the end of the day... does that make it a sort of bounty?	1
4540826	dangerous for me to...	1
3401933	The decision below that these transactions were not investment contracts merely because they specified a fixed return to the investor, rather than an unspecified portion of the enterprise's profits, can not be squared with the language, history, and purpose of the Securities Acts, 70 years of consistent SEC interpretation and enforcement, and this Court's jurisprudence.	1
3474738	And if you don't do that, we strike it.	1
548233	Does section 9 mean exactly the same thing that 10 and 11 mean, in effect, in the use of the word may?	0
1091518	Yes.	1
9383016	I don't know.	1
7227182	And the woman lawyer never raised it, is that right?	1
3997401	I don't quite understand how it --	1
1129431	[Laughter]	1
8278570	Under the Levin amendment, it is illegal for the national parties to send even a Federal dollar to a state or local party in order to, in order to participate in a, in a joint Get Out the Vote program that the state is funding in part with Levin.	1
2133115	Justice Breyer was much better than I said it.	0
2680543	[Laughter]	1
4790096	Well, I don't think I do.	1
7823713	Well, you disagree with... you disagree with the court of appeals then when they said it was not a punitive intent on the part of--	1
1683339	Suppose everything is the same, except that the organization is only for public schools, and only public schools compete in these competitions.	1
3254439	to pass a law?	1
2796009	But, what's unequivocal?	1
1109944	But you say the general economy.	1
4514554	Under this regime, it has one account, and one account only, and that is the Federal account, and with that, when that account contains donations that are, that are of a level higher than the, than the state it wants to participate in, there is a problem.	1
7521034	If the one is incorporated, why isn't the other?	1
2327958	For example, on the facts of this particular case, that there was no blood spatter remaining from the wound, and that... that no blood spatter reflected on the upholstery of the car, or no blood itself on the front passenger seat, or that the body of the... the position of the body wasn't consistent with the testimony concerning the firing of the second shot, and I think it's important to point out that in all of those avenues were, in fact, explored by the trial record... excuse me, by trial counsel, and were presented to the jury, and the jury evidently found them not persuasive.	1
7299184	Well, that, you told us, says that the assignment is deemed in law to have occurred.	1
3843983	I... I assume that we sit to require uniform interpretation of Federal law, do we not?	1
799664	Well, do you say that a tribe can never lose its sovereign rights to land?	0
8961715	arsonist...	1
6372503	Very well, Ms. Zinn.	1
7972947	It was a procedural...	1
3246398	Don't some States such as Oregon require a plaintiff to remit a portion of punitive damages recovered to the State so they don't even go to the taxpayer?	1
6872685	I I...	1
105799	f- what I was I was...	1
8259023	And all of these things would be relevant in the voluntariness inquiry, would they not?	1
2999949	First page of the blue brief?	1
186731	You do have OSHA standards.	0
8990215	I... I don't have statistics of that variety, Justice O'Connor.	1
2341840	Yes.	1
7626459	And how does that fit in with the description you just gave of... about the evidence?	1
1801869	And what you're saying is, sure, they came up with the number, ostensibly what FERC told them they could do, but they didn't go through the right process to get it, and therefore the number is no good.	1
6572471	large...	1
7432436	definition...	1
8887794	Ms. Blatt, the... there was a brief filed by Signal I think that argues that a Jones Act vessel has to provide food, care and lodging to be covered.	1
3310499	You are referring to some New York law?	1
152717	And so, it's... it's... I don't think that the test that you propose would necessarily fit within the instructions that were given, and yet that's what went to the jury.	0
6161753	But it's a very simple line to draw and certainly could be I think on the face of the statute.	1
1067920	Mr. Shiffrin, what...  what if the defendant and his lawyer both went in the courtroom when the trial date was being set and expressly said, both of them, to the court, we waive any right to be tried within the 180 days?	1
625643	But in general, I think you would look at this as one that envisions private enforcement.	0
7524030	system.	1
303757	So what are we arguing about, the legs?	1
5104948	No, you misunderstand me.	1
9291830	Substantive due process?	1
4437592	ahead.	1
2077833	And satisfied that requirement?	0
3482083	contains?	1
442658	Which one -- which one is that? Subsection.	1
3204089	I guess there's no right to do that by the Government?	1
2178597	Apparently the Internal Revenue Service didn't read that, or didn't think that everybody paid attention to it, or what?	1
1595327	Well, I suppose it does from the standpoint of the management required to make this scheme work.	1
1141404	And so we don't get beyond all these other things.	0
2688615	Well, what the statute appears to be doing is to try to go back to the pre-Employment Division v. Smith case standard under the Free Exercise Clause, which did allow for accommodation of religion.	1
803047	Yes, Your Honor.	0
6006654	With respect to the James test, Mr. Jones, there's a phrase in it that I don't understand, and could you tell me how you read the phrase that says that immunity extends to waters flood control projects cannot control?	1
1323961	for...	1
5256431	upon...	1
6960185	Surely that's not right.	1
769106	Well, that's true.	1
554549	No, but it seemed to decide the case based on its view of the statute as just applying to generic drugs or something--	0
1677355	Yes, Your Honor.	0
3986907	And they had served their sentences, presumably.	1
1113035	Well, let me ask you this with reference to this question of Justice Breyer. I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, that the district court found the hospital personnel conducted the urine drug screens for medical purposes, wholly independent of an intent to aid law enforcement efforts.	0
908847	--The formal test no, your Honor, that would not be the case at all.	0
3586603	Which was withdrawn, as I recall, after this litigation began.	1
6206275	--One--	1
1909692	Mr. Feldman, are you saying that it's an...	0
5741272	So, the tribe in effect has asked the contractor to use a term which in fact is totally meaningless, utterly misleading, and apparently an act of intentional bad faith.	1
8875873	you get going, is the case moot? Is there something left on the three year probation period?	1
1432750	Mr. Baker, are there not courts where something like this would come into the clerk's office, the signature is lacking, the clerk would say, well, it was filed within the ninety days, so we'll send it back with the letter, very much as this Court does.	1
2077939	the substantial rights.	1
4766868	worker...	1
1822573	Yes.	0
298328	This... the trunk of the car didn't have to be opened here.	0
2139848	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
4874323	[Laughter]	1
430562	Why... why isn't there still an inadequate assistance of counsel claim out there, and why shouldn't the court address that before it gets into the question that it dealt with?	0
2617164	Would that be an unenforceable or an enforceable agreement in your view?	1
1547331	Well, there's one difference between the situation that would obtain then and the situation that... that you're objecting to here.	1
1378224	But you're very unclear on what the employee has to prove to establish constructive discharge.	0
219974	I mean, relate it to this case, if you would.	1
3234821	That is not... I would respectfully submit, Your Honor, that's neither narrowly tailored nor closely drawn, not even rational.	1
5485841	That's...	1
689755	When you say this instruction, you mean the instruction that is set forth as well on page 5 of the blue brief:	1
1728481	That's kind of odd, isn't it?	1
3706309	Is it... is it operating now, the business?	1
9339131	--And what's the... what's the answer with respect to a State pardon?	1
3339953	I mean, you see, that's the horror.	1
490919	We're not talking about the Fourth Amendment and the officers and open season on the officers and what the officers can do.	0
5236004	I mean, isn't... isn't--	1
7185108	The honorable court is now adjourned until Tuesday, October twelfth at ten o'clock.	1
3906601	So the danger is that contributors to political parties are using those contributions to somehow corrupt the candidates?	1
4288687	Section 323(a) the national party prohibition is a restriction regardless of whether the amounts are coordinated or uncoordinated, a principle from the Buckley cases.	1
701341	So the Court said, we're going to look at the cases that involve the Blue Sky statutes that...  that had been in existence and had been interpreted prior to the adoption of the 33 Act.	1
9442656	concession, to be sure.	1
1007807	Well, could... could an arrest made under the circumstances I described be valid?	1
4829911	benefit the child.	1
348767	Iowa... the Iowa court made the statement, as I understand it, that the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the national Equal Protection Clause had identical requirements at least for the purposes of this case.	1
6473269	[Laughter]	1
2233429	Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:	0
7747833	But I'm not positive...	1
2194338	That's third from the bottom, basically, from a health point of view.	1
839557	plaintiff's working history.	1
5692420	No.	1
5665038	[Laughter]	1
1643895	Here there was a prompt filing at the trial court level for habeas, State habeas.	0
5147216	Right.	1
7397490	Justice Scalia, Did you have a question?	1
3945487	abandoned...	1
1772130	I guess standard tort principles don't seem to help us much.	1
8466001	Why?	1
7924320	The relevant... page six on the blue brief.	1
4781041	--You mean to repair it or to replace it?	1
7317654	--can make a reasonable taking, can't it?	1
711241	--analysis?	0
2965106	Tell me.	1
3045451	But in...  in...  in this case, there may well be special circumstances that would enter the mix.	1
508430	[Laughter]	1
7022900	That's a very unusual use of the term, flood waters.	1
6223044	You know, there's no doubt that there's substantial... that this is, I'd say, substantially related to flood control, though mostly related to irrigation, the canal, then there's no doubt that some of the time the river, the water that goes through that canal is water that would otherwise be dumped into the San Joaquin, that it was all filled up, but that's a fairly small but still substantial amount of time.	1
3441271	can happen. And...	1
8197123	--by the FDA?	1
8049895	--in the act also suspended everything for an indefinite period of time.	1
7925544	Well, we have said that the... in Minnesota v. the United States, I think we said that a proceeding against property in which the United States has an interest is a suit against the United States.	1
1015661	Why should any prejudgment interest be awarded as between States?	1
8291306	Thank you, Mr. Coleman.	1
4572186	I know it would.	1
7101745	mean somebody higher up the ladder in the employing agency?	1
8828067	No, we're assuming... I think we were assuming a narrow definition of coordinated expenses.	1
751515	Well, does it matter if, for instance, in today's world on Capitol Hill we're concerned about terrorist attacks.	0
1838094	I would think that would relate directly to manning the vessels in an area where Congress has told the Coast Guard to regulate and the Coast Guard has said what it--	0
5394411	I would like to take just a minute on the question of the... whether a typed name can constitute a signature.	1
8397728	So I thought it might be fair for you to say, well, it's... it's mixed.	1
4377749	these things.	1
1644293	[Laughter]	1
8053126	Mr. Wallace, this comes to us as a sort of as applied challenge, I guess, and in the context of provisions imposing criminal penalties.	1
8057388	Very well, Mr. Sutton.	1
9362014	Yes.	1
1809595	And you're talking now about post eligibility?	0
2007346	It just doesn't make sense.	0
8141256	--making this argument that it's inherently prejudicial even though the jury couldn't see it?	1
5952880	--What... is there anything you can say that can, in the light--	1
9507355	But wait--	1
1662696	income.	1
7782303	requirement.	1
1141651	I mean, you think about the raging Mississippi.	1
4602124	manner t-	1
4426630	I don't think it's very different.	1
2457104	Was the authority contested in the Oklahoma Courts from which this case came to us?	1
1410902	Well, what if we have the rare case?	0
828218	But are we talking about actions that constitute the commission of some kind of criminal offense in the process?	1
5531927	and...	1
2018532	So for instance, a stop might reasonably take longer if there are more people in the car so that the officer has to check the the criminal histories of more people in the car.	0
7471372	court found...	1
142907	--which I think was trying to get your argument--	1
697963	I... one of the briefs does, the City of Boston, includes in its prohibition against discrimination ex-convicts.	1
2251633	What's going on?	0
1267056	And the reasons are?	1
407897	You don't want us to know about water being in two classes?	1
2232302	Well, the petitioner says they didn't even need to get tribal court permission to get a search warrant.	1
1797774	--Well, would you answer the same question I asked Mr. Wallace.	0
225959	Is that what a majority of courts are holding?	0
5319118	It is one thing to say, look, you... you weren't even named any place in this notice within the thirty days, so we're not going to let you... you can't become an appellant after as opposed to yes, you're named in the caption, yes, you're named in the body, all that's lacking is the signature.	1
1355695	conditions.	1
5047773	But are you saying right from the very reading of this law, it is necessarily punitive?	1
8053635	How many?	1
173818	There were three named indigents.	0
1457771	Yes, Your Honor.	0
1884399	On notices of appeal?	1
7786827	Is this--	1
179973	Your Honor, it is the formal act.	0
1124395	Well, would that include... if a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include law clerk memos to the judge?	0
1951308	Well, may I ask a question?	0
9251607	Now there are.	1
496293	What does that include?	0
6291550	do anything about it.	1
7246015	Thank you, Mr. Uelmen.	1
4949475	She's making...	1
1001592	At the time Mr. Castro appealed, had AEDPA been enacted?	1
2686233	And I thought you said that's okay.	1
4653289	Is the Super Scoop practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?	1
1867351	It's... it's sort of like pornography: I know it when I see it.	0
5800236	--Well, in order to ameliorate that possibility, Justice Souter, the Seventh Circuit, for example, has adopted a standard under which it will not decide a claim of ineffectiveness in the defendant's favor unless there's no possible strategic rationale for counsel's decision and, of course, to the extent that there may be a strategic rationale for the counsel's decision, it'll be in the Government's interest to bring that to the court's attention in its appellate briefing, and we haven't seen too many situations in which a court grants a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal, but yet there was potentially a strategic rationale for counsel's decision.	1
5620008	she she she...	1
1889143	What difference does it make?	0
222703	And one of the questions we have to answer is whether the tribe is a person under section 1983.	0
8456359	Mr. Kerrigan, G & G Fire Sprinklers, the respondent here, they are the sub we're talking about here?	1
6875632	No, I know that's what you're contending and I agree with you totally that there are those differences.	1
8527172	Isn't that the end of the delegation issue?	1
95313	--Wasn't that your answer?	1
3707374	Your Honor.	1
4196190	No, Your Honor, I don't...	1
1284598	But I don't see how you can call it substantive, if it's just going to witness competency.	0
7013239	So what it boils down to is the state had at least two ways in which Penry could rationally have been given consideration, and instead the court decided to do it in an irrational way saying even if all the evidence leads to a yes answer, you can say no any way, and that's to me the nub of the problem here because if as we have repeatedly said the jury is supposed to engage in some kind of a reasoned moral process, this was not a reasoned moral process; it was an irrational process.	1
2871208	Because I mean that's what I'm trying to get a response to.	1
5541379	Is there a duty to have a person there on the floor?	1
8793509	You're talking about the condition today, and what you're saying today is, whenever FERC sets a tariff that leaves the bottom line number to be filled in later, a State utility commission in a ratemaking proceeding may challenge that bottom line number in its own bailiwick.	1
3993972	At the time Mr. Castro appealed, had AEDPA been enacted?	1
703996	--in the Federal habeas context, the AEDPA law suggests there's a great premium paid... at stake for promptly resolving these things.	1
9101048	Are you saying that the rationale for what happened here was just inadvertence.	1
3311765	If we start with the assumption that there is some discretion over the matter of interest, why couldn't we resolve the tension between the findings with respect to those two dates with a rule like this, that interest will be awardable from the time at which the violation either was or should have been known, and from the time after that at which suit was instituted, to avoid the problem of allowing a State, as apparently Kansas did here, to sit on its rights from 1969 to whatever it was, 1977?	1
8718402	Is there any case of ours where we have so held?	1
7372143	Thank you, Mr. Thompson.	1
3901040	It's peculiar.	1
7189317	Is that your position?	1
7204115	is that it?	1
7074919	that there is.	1
120521	You can just presume that the proceeding was regular and it was disclosed.	0
955701	[Laughter]	1
6992047	[Inaudible]	1
2540564	As a result, I suppose the nondiscrimination policy doesn't apply.	1
4542876	Now, you say that's just shorthand for those portions of Greensboro that were reliably Democratic.	1
1465577	--I suppose you could answer Justice Scalia by saying that these are exceptions to the ordinary rule of finality, although the statute doesn't quite read that way.	1
8783590	--What's wrong about warning the public about who may be dangerous?	1
9240633	jobs?	1
1515374	together the --	1
3790720	[Laughter]	1
8354968	Do you have to... if you're a school that plays in this league, do you have to send somebody to this organization to vote on such things as this rule that you're objecting to?	1
1960979	Mr. Falk--	0
6168965	do nothing. Oh  tell me the answer. Yeah.	1
3252372	But don't we have an issue here between billboards more than 500 and less than 1,000 feet from the schools?	1
6972539	But presumably for the hotels that are not on fee land, at least, they are not... the guests are not paying a state tax or a county tax.	1
3831578	Yes, you may, General Waxman.	1
4889396	specific...	1
4971180	O'Connor.	1
4996924	What if, under the plan, it's true that the districts reduced the black voter population somewhat from the prior districting, but in so doing, they picked up enough black voters in another district that gave them an additional elected official of the minority race--	1
7888686	But presumably it can't, under that agreement, release more than the farmers can use for flood control purposes without the agreement of the parties.	1
7553155	Every claim like that would end up in court under some kind of constitutional analysis.	1
846150	How do we know when it's constitutionally significant if that's the line?	1
799537	Two people who live together but they're not married.	0
296127	Well, Your Honor, I think he did understand that he was going to get 15 years.	0
5305230	--question?	1
4855725	Mr. Olson, I'd like to get focused a little more on this same area.	1
3338950	Mr. Roberts, we'll hear from you.	1
7444229	We're dealing here with a case from the State of Washington, and you assert there is no such requirement in Washington.	1
4947741	Why does...	1
2074211	In other respects it looks punitive.	1
1572560	Why should we prefer the one rather than the other?	1
3759010	to...	1
4912177	--Well, you do agree, though, I guess that were efforts to include language authorizing the obtaining of injunctions by private petitioners, and that was not adopted by Congress.	1
5223625	What's wrong with their argument?	1
6884541	Right.	1
2476366	Now here's what you do next, write some checks to the party.	1
309517	May I ask whether you think your client was a State actor before... 1995, was it, they changed the rules?	1
2730616	Surely it's not in the statute that there must be a cost/benefit analysis.	1
2256680	--If it is the end of the traffic stop, it is not.	0
1761268	But you think that rule (f) is invalid?	1
5875190	close to...	1
4409977	Well, the buyer takes it expecting to have to make a Penn Central type takings challenge.	1
4663497	At the end of the...	1
3355348	employee or something?	1
558712	This is a Wal-Mart dress.	1
1331855	It would be...  and then they put catch-all provisions.	1
1854463	Maybe I'm not reading it right--	0
830022	Yes.	1
1062312	In addition, affirmance would lead to habeas litigation concerning defaulted meritless post plea appeals.	0
9360744	And Congress recognizes--	1
641730	It wasn't just a rule for Federal courts, was it?	1
2463841	I think that's just contrary to normal usage.	1
2632897	as the cause.	1
6973433	They said, they are identical.	1
2053697	I just thought it was a little curious that if some means of solving this had been offered, why we're here.	1
479779	Well, here we have a case where the employee did not settle, but we were really discussing with you the possibility not presented in this case of a full settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of the victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should EEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim-specific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to address the overall problem.	0
1951372	That just seems so contrary to what Congress intended.	1
5435750	And did they ever sue in any California court to recover what they claim to have been owed?	1
8836791	person That that person...	1
5975445	Well, but of course, there's been a couple of centuries of practice in this country of not funding religious instruction by tax money.	1
6200197	Different mores.	1
829559	It sounds like coordination to me.	1
6543795	"--I don't like to use the word ""affirmative action"", because that has a connotation in some other... but you have to take an... affirmative steps for the rest of your life in... in some cases."	1
2582689	Were those State law cases and State constitutional cases?	1
4762952	Do we owe any deference to common sense in recognizing that when Congress draws up campaign funding legislation, it is more likely to draw up a system that favors incumbents and is it not true that this rule of course favors incumbents because the one who suffers the most when he can't get significant funding from the party is the new candidate, the unknown face who is running against an incumbent?	1
5951270	I think--	1
7991197	I thought--	1
503084	Now, do you concede that water could be released into the Madera Canal for flood control purposes, for example to make more room in the reservoir for flood waters that are anticipated?	0
8399737	Why wouldn't you say, but there are no facts?	1
44798	The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment?	0
1122371	benefit the child.	1
1747068	What is the difference between a present property interest in my employment and a present property interest in the money that you owe me?	1
7978229	[Inaudible]	1
2169264	--they were found very close to the driver, you know, sometimes there's a little pocket right next to--	0
2956204	Do you agree with--	1
2168125	I have forms I have to fill out four times a year for the Government.	1
462367	I don't think so.	1
6285789	--But form 58... I'm... I'm looking at page 58... says that the prisoner will be given this form that says you were referred to the classification committee for the following reasons.	1
2211384	So that isn't some kind of a waiver?	0
7954949	The argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use... growing for personal use, under prescription--	1
2909944	term...	1
6911523	It's just a matter of...  as a matter of convenience for everyone, I wonder why the prosecutor didn't point out that it was beyond the 180 days.	1
9296791	would be that the Border Patrol agents were all at the checkpoint and wouldn't be out in the field to to be able to follow up on any information from the sensor.	1
6693562	Yes.	1
7529481	Let's say that this is not a coordinated expense.	1
7811560	What is clear here?	1
1405847	But you do not take that view.	0
1829679	I'm sorry.	0
4310945	You don't think it even mean Tribal Court, do you?	1
1886411	--And what's the... what's the answer with respect to a State pardon?	1
938387	You might need to.	1
6669642	--Well, Mr. Srinivasan, do you say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and the tribes did somehow contract away Federal... inherent Federal functions?	1
137642	Yeah, but...	0
9587047	petition. But...	1
1709004	Could the State ban adults from receiving advertising of that sort?	1
4403350	I thought that it was... when Colorado, or perhaps Kansas, knew that Kansas water was being depleted, and when you were able to prove in court how much, wasn't there something in the record that until there was computer modeling you couldn't estimate with any degree of accuracy--	1
7443817	I mean, some States don't have legislative history.	1
5964925	That is, full-time employee--	1
556230	You say they're not able to say that in a contract?	1
283568	All right.	0
162845	Your...	1
7908535	But--	1
796985	Okay.	0
7723150	Yes, but both Place and Edmond, opinions from this Court, said sniffs are not searches.	1
548354	Your Honor. And B two A is --	1
1222919	So, it could charge...	0
5843855	I mean, why don't we look at the statute and see whether it is necessary that this allegation that the U.S. was not substantially justified has to be made within 30 days?	1
8383176	That sure doesn't seem to me to establish whether the principal is serving as an agent of the Government or is serving on his own.	1
5550918	And even though they're appearing in that body as a representative of their school, not as an individual?	1
502779	It would be impossible to administer this statute.	1
4750474	But what nonretroactivity means for new appellate procedures is that you do not apply them to any cases that have not... that have already been appealed.	1
1752889	Well, the public isn't buying it.	1
8737507	The people that are the least...  that are the most risk-averse are looking for guarantees of returns and fixed returns.	1
4444031	What... what is the basis of the... is this some kind of a facial challenge to the whole scheme of regulating noncontact visits?	1
8377810	the city did not study the combination but, rather, relied on judicially approved statutory precedent from other jurisdictions.	1
6676676	Yes, we did.	1
966206	Now was there a factual component to that issue that makes it impossible for the trial judge to determine or could there be?	0
2108396	The second key section is thirty-one eleven.	0
3484627	I I mean, I mean, you know it...	1
189275	What's wrong with their argument?	1
3237158	This is a religious test.	1
4049771	Is that jurisdictional?	1
9123339	That is what this investment contract was.	1
4516953	If... if we agreed with your view... and I'm not sure we will... about property including the right to control business assets, it does not, I assume, cover some personal right of somebody to obtain services in the clinic.	1
6151064	But again, if we accepted your view that it makes a difference, then all these building contracts would suddenly become State action under Roth, Zindeman, et cetera.	1
7963068	prosecution proces- the standards for prosecutors in the United States for the United States are set forth in the the i- US Attorney's Manual.	1
5290011	And is... does any other State have such a policy, written or otherwise?	1
7166753	They may have given different reasons, but four have said that the States' authority has not been taken away from them by the Federal Government.	1
6523966	Counsel, Your time is far off still.	1
3213958	What do we...	1
7282511	non ver-	1
6762134	I mean, most of the population of Massachusetts, I don't know what the situation is... we now have those maps... and yet I think it's very important to your argument, on my assumption.	1
897210	--I can give you--	0
1529097	And is there a finding below that medication will... there's a substantial probability he would be restored to competence if there were medication?	1
1465224	Would we have to... would we have to reverse in part Rose against Lundy to go with your view?	0
5995040	Thank you, Your Honor.	1
2669935	I suppose the most likely scenario for significant contribution would be the notion that I will give this money, and expect in return that if and when I ever call this particular official, if the official is elected, they'll pay attention to me.	1
3675640	How many circuits have held that there is no preemption of size and location regulations?	1
3760208	individual payment...	1
9530178	But certainly the other interpretation is a reasonable one as well, in which case it becomes evidence that predominantly they were trying to put together a district that had predominantly black voters in it.	1
9285665	Mr. Feldman, do we need to apply the clear statement rule of Gregory v. Ashcroft for you to prevail?	1
6441993	so forth. Those...	1
2483543	Yes, Your Honor.	1
5809599	How... how many cases are there?	1
395478	Where would we find that?	0
2105516	That nothing about it was, the allocation and so forth.	1
8865087	and lies at the foundation...	1
2094604	was...	1
3420986	That's the fiction.	1
1692082	And you think that there can never be a trade dress protection in some aspect of an expired patented item?	0
2028941	I mean, what--	1
8442699	Suppose you have a case in which 10 jurors are excused because of their expressed views on the death penalty, excused by the State.	1
1863444	And one wonders why the Government wants to take such a... an extreme position even though it lawfully could.	1
3522466	--What percent is it?	1
174520	quintessential...	1
3974792	--But is there... there's no final judgment there, is there, on the attorney's fees?	1
4981792	It is not passive.	1
2344924	Yes, but that's possible to do.	0
7109398	It was just a question of whether or not people are covered for Social Security purposes.	1
4342114	Do you take into account that the degree of harm, if you make a mistake?	1
2672473	work out.	1
6660971	Do you think that that case would stand up under your analysis?	1
9475684	Yeah, but when the yeah, and when the kid when the kid...	1
3145390	--Well, again, that's... that's not... that's really not clear.	1
6071202	--But they're just as indeterminate.	1
9453413	I mean, just... you began by saying that since this prohibits all adult speech, isn't that more extensive than necessary under the Central Hudson test?	1
3463574	Well, does it make a difference?	1
7512577	typically.	1
5271168	But now we're, now we're... what I'm positing is a system in which the political party, which everybody esteems for different reasons, perhaps, but everybody supports, now, on your theory the political party can simply be given another useful task and the useful task, in effect, would be to eliminate the need of the candidate to be scrambling for the $100 contributions if it could accept, in effect, through the party, contributions in the amounts that Justice Breyer was talking about in his hypo a while ago.	1
3763271	Your Honor.	1
9274955	But you just said the manual instructed them not to bring cases to trial.	1
5847188	Right.	1
5734021	certainly up front...	1
999782	Well, presumably you could question supervisory employees who prepare payroll records and ask them how much have you paid these people, if anything.	1
511136	Well, it also says, or by any other means authorized by law, so isn't that the issue?	1
490688	Yes.	0
1806827	He is given less of an advantage than all...	1
192895	Well, what is the constitutional basis for your argument?	1
2889444	Well, you're not discriminating against out-of-staters, which is a Federal concern.	1
1698695	You do?	0
937172	gross amount...	1
7837462	--Is that conceded, that the principals could be instructed to vote a certain way in this organization?	1
5147426	Well, I'm asking you to.	1
8697760	But...	1
758986	What's the line?	0
3337511	That's--	1
5677071	Thank you, Mr. Taylor.	1
8261328	Honor. That is my position.	1
3972732	Isn't that the end of the delegation issue?	1
8269170	But the national party committees cannot transfer even down $10 to the state party for a voter mobilization plan.	1
5398279	That's what I'm not following.	1
9588026	This is written in terms of purpose, so whether it's intent, or purpose, or motive, treat them the same.	1
7143331	My next question is, has that Tribal Court ever considered an arbitration case involving people off the reservation?	1
1614122	Did you finish with the inquiry of whether we should recognize this plaintiff?	0
3854877	It's a kind of garnishment, I guess, and that's what makes it a little different from the ordinary contract case.	1
2991587	And I don't understand what it is that you are saying.	1
4590908	And the reason that...	1
9526490	Apparently, the Government takes that position, as narrowly as I could determine.	1
6710779	It's such a small segment of the problem.	1
4374762	It remains...	1
1094281	You're trying to shoehorn it under the rule of evidence category, number four?	0
3708778	But, you think clear waiver necessarily means the same standards that are required for a waiver by a state under the Eleventh Amendment?	1
846616	How do we distinguish the dog sniff cases, where we've upheld the use of police dogs to sniff luggage for narcotics?	0
886374	Did we not?	0
7150289	The... the statute says, pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause.	1
445659	In a trial situation it can usually be assumed that the defendant does want to continue the litigation.	0
5007448	If the methane comes out in drilling, as in gaseous form, and I'm a chemistry student, is the formula for the methane gas the same as the formula for, say, hard anthracite coal?	1
1412447	But in Digital Equipment, I think that we said that the collateral order doctrine is narrow, it should stay that way, and that we should give it... we should be very reluctant to expand the practical construction of section 1291.	1
8867378	Suppose I were to say, what that means is that the water is where it is for a purpose substantially related to flood control.	1
69068	Then I still--	1
8109135	If they don't engage in at least 40 percent state election activity, their Federal percentage is higher than 60 percent.	1
8798936	So why does it make any difference if they simply, instead of picking one percentage, charge 5 percent on the parimutuel and 34 percent on the slot machines?	1
1872871	Then why don't we leave it alone?	1
1257114	was...	1
3406378	Yes.	1
4122620	You say they're not able to say that in a contract?	1
5020466	What the Court has repeatedly referred to is the...  from the standpoint of the investor, what the investor is expecting to do is to put his or her money to work for him or her, that is to say, put that money into an enterprise of some sort so the investor can sit back and watch the returns come in.	1
563073	--When--	0
2790274	[Laughter]	1
4089625	entirely excludes section...	1
3466223	cases like...	1
3915736	Too bad.	1
1450140	Are... are there separate questions?	1
5202452	But I didn't think that the England case just totally destroyed the notion of full faith and credit--	1
4192828	[Inaudible]	1
8498621	Sometime during your argument, could you address that?	1
5603090	Are there situations where the city or town is particularly aware of traffic problems within the city or a weak bridge or something and that its limitations are needed?	1
2322137	Handing of the ticket is when the tasks are done.	0
2618918	adult videotapes? And you think he...	1
9300099	You say, if I understand your case, you wouldn't take a position that flood waters are never... you're not going to try to prove that flood waters were never released through this canal, but you would say categorically that the canal itself, when constructed, had no flood control purpose.	1
1235045	[Laughter]	1
3912759	So, in your view, the only thing at issue is fees earned, if you will, after the effective date of PLRA?	1
455960	a situ- in a situation...	1
4185065	Well, I mean--	1
971067	Do you take the position that trying to find a witness was some kind of an exigent circumstance here?	1
6595114	[Laughter]	1
4318040	Once...	1
5759511	They're taxed differently.	1
6698730	We...	1
8509244	With all due respect --	1
5252368	Right.	1
3178631	I thought that...	1
5073906	I just... do we treat the two differently?	1
740468	What's it going to do?	0
1169628	And normally we apply strict scrutiny.	0
4255281	[Laughter]	1
7160818	posting them in newspapers.	1
5213953	case...	1
2146875	[Laughter]	1
4837751	Mr. Geller, is it... explain to us, if you would, the practice of the FDA with regard to authorized drugs and devices.	1
8594480	Well, but blessedly there are farmers who want to use it, so of course it's released.	1
1430592	Not this one.	1
15194	they're not...	0
1286320	Was any objection made below at that time to the amendment?	0
778348	Well, h- how can you tell...	1
379707	can charge...	0
5115630	Is that... you're both in agreement that would do?	1
630159	instruction and guidance.	1
215010	--Yes, Your Honor, that would -- that would.	0
9564824	is not I...	1
6127504	--Ms. Grunder, do you agree with opposing counsel that even if evaluated under the Turner rule, properly applied, that California's policy would not survive?	1
8431927	The State courts are perfectly free to do that under their own constitutions, but when it gets to us, we will not accept, for example, the determination in a case like this by Iowa that the purpose was not to aid riverboat gambling.	1
367389	an objection to the --	1
2065283	to obtain punitive damages.	1
1324888	It made the decision that it was probable cause.	0
2288453	Ms. Brinkmann, do you know what exemption is urged by Salomon Brothers to cover them?	0
3477703	I'm...	1
6078794	I mean, I don't understand why we're using that term at all in light of the case background here.	1
7402967	Well, in that...	1
3357856	[Laughter]	1
8283827	They agree most of the time, irrigation, some of the time, for just overflow of flood water.	1
6096752	Yes, and I guess that isn't before us--	1
492341	But it's part of an entire project.	1
2221223	[Laughter]	1
9554289	Well, Mr. Frederick, that just isn't the immunity statute.	1
1559588	Is that all right?	1
9037392	How can they do that?	1
7972467	indiscretion...	1
1082719	What do we do generally, if you look at our precedents, on mixed questions of fact and law on appellate review?	0
4065969	violated.	1
1067654	I just don't know of any past case that would suggest such a requirement when it comes to law enforcement requests by citizens of police.	1
9641488	interpretation does.	1
1301696	Is that your position?	1
1265454	It didn't just enter a stay order, as would typically be the case.	0
759580	That is something that you can do as a reviewing court, because the facts have been established.	0
3541058	Well.	1
2236344	Why should we say it is State action when he is doing absolutely... the prime is doing absolutely nothing more than the prime could do under the general law of contract?	1
8436417	The Court has never made this distinction.	1
7322743	Then what you're saying is that if you have 50 countervailing factors you may get a more informed judgment.	1
4893018	Ah, yes.	1
7786429	And how does that fit in with the description you just gave of... about the evidence?	1
231767	In this case, the stated reason I think we assume, at least according to the trial judge's instruction to the jury, was unlawful.	0
1155105	Some, but apparently never claimed that the administrative law judge should have ordered a consultative examination.	0
7824638	And this Court has said, because promoters are so creative, these terms must be flexible and inclusive.	1
226513	Have we ever allowed a prospective waiver of a statutory right--	0
7983179	The argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use... growing for personal use, under prescription--	1
3049727	I didn't catch the last word, Mr.... are what?	1
1334123	And if I could give you a hypothetical that--	0
4020753	he did absolutely nothing, then we have to wrestle with whether you divide it from, you know, sentencing phase from guilt innocence phase, and so forth.	1
8434727	and when the least say...	1
282651	Well, what do the annual...	1
5332747	the burden.	1
118444	That the manmade structures have separated them and they're no longer unitary.	0
7259327	Irres-	1
86195	Mr. Baran.	1
7011159	Yeah.	1
4691125	It does...  it does come from Howey, and I think that the best way to look at that, Justice Kennedy, is to look at that the investor, as opposed to using his own resources, his own efforts, his own energy, his own creativity, is counting on other people to make the...  the instrument...	1
1371086	person who's been convicted?	1
8317916	They can say what they want in the compact.	1
2049291	That's not my question, and... and it relates to what is the burden of the State in these situations to use the visible restraints?	0
9202838	Mr. Verrilli?	1
5016279	--I think the kick of the gas tank or the tapping showed it was full, not hollow.	1
75782	Did we not?	0
8735958	Is it jurisdictional, do you think, here as well as in the court of appeals?	1
6565154	I can't find it in the blue brief... 108?	1
5838045	"--I don't like to use the word ""affirmative action"", because that has a connotation in some other... but you have to take an... affirmative steps for the rest of your life in... in some cases."	1
1254618	I think Justice O'Connor is right.	1
1917545	But I thought that's what you wanted to ignore?	1
7519306	and this very case, this person was found to have all kinds of indications of having been planning and perhaps having committed a number of very serious offenses while on probation.	1
9339166	And here we have to deter...	1
970083	reasonable...	1
4196185	Right?	1
8474646	Well...	1
619046	Well, I understand your point.	0
1639664	Well, we have said that the... in Minnesota v. the United States, I think we said that a proceeding against property in which the United States has an interest is a suit against the United States.	1
7983129	But in response to Justice O'Connor's question, there are no exigent circumstances of the type that would eliminate the need to knock and announce at all.	1
43784	Well, wasn't a warrant obtained from a magistrate here?	1
6796927	Justice Souter, they're not live action. That's the difference.	1
329220	Well, now, the parties presumably could agree among themselves in the contract what law to apply.	1
8417127	Probably not, but I just wonder about the kind of practice if the lawyer doesn't point it out to the court.	1
3283554	--I mean, why can't we just make the assumption that if one side knew or should have known, the other side knew or should have known?	1
12782	But he will...	1
7555701	--how much was involved, and that wasn't until the eighties.	1
1251306	something that has...	1
7821040	It's always hard, though.	1
1299905	Mr. Davidson, am I right in thinking, in relation to your opening remarks, that the States, when they came into the Union, as this was an inducement, could not have been contemplating the asset of this gas, because practically there was no way economically that it could be extracted?	1
109824	I say, when you get to the garden, I don't want any of those gardeners walking with their muddy boots in the house, and so here's what happens.	1
9366123	It wasn't until James that we held that immunity applied to anything except property damage.	1
6199591	Is that... on what theory?	1
1863224	Even though some other employee on the basis of greater seniority than the respondents under the plan could take that slot?	1
3862335	Well, Your HonorIf...	1
4411861	[Inaudible]	1
7837	But now we're talking about an ordinance that doesn't focus on the concentration of adult businesses but, rather, the combination, because the city doesn't want the business to break into two parts, even though it tried to operate as one business, and I guess the the nineteen seventy-seven study didn't address the combination, the effects of a combination of focuses in a single business, whereas your ordinance does.	0
4095602	But...	1
6076380	--statute says.	1
2116770	I just want to get clear on the point that you and I discussed a minute ago on your exception to the Master's finding that you should have known in '69.	1
5936659	Suppose everything is the same, except that the organization is only for public schools, and only public schools compete in these competitions.	1
992012	I asked you whether, as applied to someone who is exceedingly dangerous, in your view does the scheme survive?	1
10620	Well, I just thought I--	1
5568968	This is in the Federal court system now.	1
4551087	Can I ask about the beach club, I thought after the beach club application you came up with another application that was just... just to fill.	1
7092938	But if they are using Levin money, it's a crime.	1
501060	--In the 280 jurisdiction?	1
5661114	[Laughter]	1
8739088	What happens...	1
3342798	this...	1
2206535	That's that's true, Justice Kennedy.	0
9243241	have to --	1
2234475	biggest companies in the United States.	0
716652	In other words...	0
2104138	How are they differentiated?	0
793412	--conditions.	0
1806057	disability as an expectation-	1
5785693	Right. Yes.	1
1230636	--all... all along?	0
2329796	But he never says anything.	0
1014075	--One -- once we accept that -- that a stop can be incrementally prolonged for purposes of a dog sniff if that dog sniff occurs during the stop, so that the officer is doing nothing but that dog sniff, he's adding a 1-minute to a 10-minute dog sniff, then the question would be whether that 11-minute total stop is reasonable.	0
4972959	the so-called parallelism with section nineteen eighty-three actions.	1
3793378	--of any instance in which any case involving arbitration was decided by this particular court?	1
4075978	--I don't know quite how to deal with it.	1
2370298	But the main coach, even in the private school, would have to be a full-time employee?	1
3869157	Well, don't you think that a jury is entitled to consider the interest of every witness who testifies, and the fact that certainly the defendant is always an interested witness.	1
3130680	spouse...	1
9089533	So the fact that they may not have been able to prove the precise predicate, which is the modeling predicate for the computation of money damages now, doesn't prove that they shouldn't have sued earlier.	1
1188438	Is that in fact how it was done?	0
4097856	All of them.	1
1024399	I somehow thought that your question had boiled down to whether there was issue preclusion here.	1
542891	It looks like seven...	1
548161	That was the section I read to you...	0
7113987	addressing...	1
983014	--Well, the statute here doesn't say anything about what is supposed to happen.	0
1474598	Mr. Phillips, this is a facial challenge?	0
436905	It's kind of a loaded question, Judge, I think.	0
3215882	Is that... that was the problem the court had below.	1
1674179	--On this so-called lodging--	1
7020966	So, it is describing a court by reference to a certain kind of subject matter jurisdiction that that court has.	1
1661655	worth of wages.	1
1432253	I don't think it's an entitlement, Justice Sotomayor.	0
724504	I mean, I don't understand why we're using that term at all in light of the case background here.	1
8977505	w- Well, no -- my predisposes...	1
7758522	[Laughter]	1
9028478	you know posel- I  I...	1
3269810	Are you abandoning that argument now?	1
9222524	precludes us from f-	1
3642926	And doesn't that bring us back to what Justice Scalia said?	1
6847166	I mean what's the matter with that?	1
4835369	that there's a consensus and want to argue it's just not enduring? Or what is it you're...	1
7730976	opportunity.	1
5339491	You... you are asserting that Doe I and II are people who are no longer dangerous.	1
4820680	I just don't know.	1
7404721	It isn't.	1
8174345	Are you talking about the Fifth or the Ninth?	1
4497311	the case.	1
7978809	And in the normal...	1
4287955	We don't understand what you're alleging.	1
1922569	bit further...	1
2496243	Even if even if we...	1
4285207	I see.	1
7922211	Is the principal expected, out of his private purse, to fund his participation in this organization?	1
9633632	And (b)(4) and 323(b)(2)(B)(iv), it says the amounts expended or disbursed are made solely from the funds raised by the state, local or district committee which makes such expenditure or disbursement and do not include any funds provided to such committee--	1
2521490	That was the finding of the magistrate and the--	1
4142693	you would prevail at trial...	1
511443	prosecuted?	1
2701745	What's wrong with their argument?	1
123995	--I think that--	0
1259554	But it's not recognized in the Federal statute or in the regulations.	0
9020039	and...	1
6305675	--Under the Florida legislative scheme?	1
1282608	If the answer is no, I wonder what happens to... it seems to me your position has considerable implication for the authority of this Court in criminal cases.	1
1943026	Well, following a guilty plea...	0
1978751	that...	1
4434709	like a...	1
4863636	Well, what do you concede is left open to States in this area?	1
3265244	I somehow had the impression that we were dealing here with a crossing that had crossbucks installed under the minimum program for a State.	1
5813565	And the school could say, we're only going to allow after school use for athletic purposes.	1
2508544	true? Is that what having a foundation means?	1
2420507	And some other people too?	1
511052	thought that wouldn't do it because Hart addressed the health effects...	1
1779218	home searches...	1
703324	Well, I thought we were looking to see if some other, lower employee was covered, not these directors, and that turns on whether you count them as employees--	1
2314310	It's a little odd in this Pittman Act because it... it does in section 8 refer to valuable minerals, but at various other times in the act, it just says minerals.	0
3322005	An hourly rate that it enhances somewhat or the risk factor, or even a contingent fee could be reasonable, as long as it doesn't exceed 25 percent.	1
1145860	Right.	0
920088	One other point.	1
3031887	Yes.	1
5450795	--Mr. Sutton, you reach an interesting conclusion if you put together the first and the second parts of your argument.	1
1420429	The formal test--	0
2281555	So you don't agree with petitioner's counsel that it's a harder case, but wouldn't give it up?	1
4046571	Yes.	1
5476361	[Laughter]	1
8868271	I'm repeating it--	1
2673484	Yes.	1
2550135	then what meaning do we give to reasonable accommodation in the ADA?	1
1118999	I'm sorry, Judge.	0
542358	I mean, you... you didn't... the court below didn't think that privacy was limited to this... to the deceased?	1
1188876	How many months you want, two?	1
1156474	I got pulled over for a driving offense, then it -- it -- then it is over.	0
2092613	Up to the effective date.	0
2520597	--It isn't clear from Williamson County that this Court envisioned two... two separate determinations of fact issues: one in State court and one in Federal.	1
8164544	No, no, not still do exist.	1
4720948	used specifically  here.	1
1191687	And so we think that if the officer is able to do a dog sniff within a reasonable time, and still is reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic stop violation, it ought to be constitutionally permissible.	0
1460212	The... the... I'm not, don't... I'm accepting this for the sake of argument only.	1
8561678	I sh- I sure do.	1
1741530	E-	1
2902206	I... I understand that the... the percentage of sex offenses in Alaska with children is extremely high, and what is... has been the effect of this scheme if it's been employed?	1
4311218	There was no economic extraction, then, in that period.	1
2936132	[Laughter]	1
3380164	[Laughter]	1
9519588	So is there... why isn't there then a question here as to whether this set of fill regulations is reasonable or unreasonable?	1
8004818	No problem.	1
409162	Do you... do you think that any other provisions of the Communications Act are enforceable under 1983?	1
5507381	eighty-two.	1
1635272	And now when I look at the district judge's opinion, one of his points, one of them was not just the war of experts.	1
4492973	Am I correct... just so I get your view on it... am I correct that with respect to an unexpired statute of limitations where there's an attempt by the legislature to extend it, the law is really very well settled that that's permissible?	1
2769186	given in this case that the attorney did provide that there was ineffective assistance at sentencing? Do we take that as a a gi-	1
682510	What would be the situation if there were truly a vacant position at US Airways in customer service? Would would you think the ADA would say that it would be a reasonable accommodation to consider a disabled employee for placement in one of those...	0
4375051	No, no, I suppose it's nobody's fault, you know.	1
417896	I don't think that's atypical of what happens in research.	0
478720	We...	1
8784496	Instead of promising the sky or...  or a speculative return, the investors that develop these types of schemes will simply say 50 percent or 25 percent...	1
2916480	--if you, if you, if your clients here had been given the review that has been described to us in the government's brief, by military authorities to determine whether these people are indeed being held as enemy combatants, would you be here if you knew that that review had been provided?	1
9604215	Well, but if the petition contains no facts, you wouldn't point that out?	1
9546978	To t- use the sticks...	1
1192020	Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented?	0
9310528	What has it got to do with the matter that it's overly broad, et cetera, which sounds to me like a substantive due process argument, not an ex post facto argument?	1
105526	So we have to decide that, do we?	1
547542	You just say there are interests on both sides, so... well, there's no way to... there's no scale in heaven or anything else, other than judgment, that tells us what the just and reasonable rate is in terms of return to an investor, and similarly there's nothing other than judgment that would tell you here how far down the health scale you go before it's not really required by public health.	1
845266	Now, what would constitute a retroactive application of each one of those three is quite different.	1
1029231	In common parlance, we would think a clearly erroneous standard was not as strict a standard as substantial evidence.	0
3867959	No, no.	1
8777228	But when there are joint activities that have an effect on both elections, the regulating entity, state government or Federal government, cannot impair or nullify... is the term the Court used then... impair or nullify the other sovereign's interest.	1
2612605	Well, what should we do here?	1
4626819	--and so forth.	1
373493	Well, it is for the very reasons we've explored this morning.	0
1998393	So I... I think there's a problem here.	0
3063668	To to justify in court. Right.	1
378194	So you think Congress intended to prevent the EPA from enforcing new ozone national ambient air quality standards anywhere in the country?	1
1967232	Well, we think there is a law enforcement interest in officers having some leeway to sequence the stop as they see fit.	0
875891	--You mean to repair it or to replace it?	1
465042	Well, but I mean, how is that different?	1
1758835	What's going on here?	0
5447966	Congress had to approve it.	1
4049143	You would agree I take it that we would... we were not required in order to establish a clear standard we were not required in Penry One to say the instructions have got to call for a rational process, the instructions have got to call for a process that reasonable jurors could at least intellectually follow,... I take it that if we found a deficiency on such points as that that you would not feel that Edpa stood in the way of granting relief here.	1
485861	Let's assume that it can be demonstrated that eating regularly at fast food joints, including McDonald's, causes health problems throughout life for kids, would you give me the principle in your reasoning that would prevent the State of Massachusetts from similarly restricting advertising by McDonald's--	1
1133390	And... and under the Secretary's rules, if there is in fact a conflict of interest, it can be weighed in making that ultimate resolution by the court?	1
6274813	Is it because the judge could imagine reasons that the prosecutor might have had?	1
8707883	It's... it's hard to say because there's no hard scientific data, and I--	1
5384839	--Isn't there the obvious--	1
1066596	Now, there's no record here of the colloquy at the plea?	0
3282777	Throughout your opening brief, you never referred to that statute.	1
1696878	Well, I have trouble with that in times of high water.	1
8950926	So we have to decide that, do we?	1
1405007	Well, what if the house is used... the property is put up to get a mortgage to get money to go into an interstate trucking business?	0
7952430	But this... this scheme does something else, it seems to me.	1
1854642	--Mr. Sutton, there were congressional findings that there has been discrimination against the disabled in voting, health services, transportation, education, and so on, and there are numerous examples in the legislative record, and those are areas of traditional State control.	1
108401	Mr. Phillips, this dichotomy that's gone on since 1946, has anybody in Congress tried to straighten this out, do you know?	1
2485011	What we're asking you to speculate on is if the Government prevails and we say, fine, you can take the gas tank off, you don't have to have any degree of reasonable suspicion.	1
1189545	Well, I assume we have to take this case on the... the premise that the state somehow knew that the state had paid the money to Farr, and I guess also had promised some kind of a break not making certain criminal charges?	0
214886	Would such cases merit a CPC?	1
1233310	You want us to overrule earlier cases about--	0
839750	Does the use of communicated to the clerk suggest that it be express?	0
5151201	I don't think it's very different.	1
4843045	The sub has a right to be paid for the work that he did in accordance with his contract with the prime, and that right is either good or bad quite independent of what is happening between the prime and the State.	1
3609897	It says, no statement relating to smoking and health shall be required.	1
3175483	What would have happened if the disclosure about Albuterol was made before the company announced revenue shortfalls?	1
1993550	arguing?	1
2154556	It recorded only the heat being emitted from the home.	0
3189260	do we give here? At the time this claim was evaluated, the regulations hadn't been adopted.	1
8409278	No, but seriously, I mean, what... how could that standard ever be satisfied in the case Justice Breyer gave you, except on... you know, some silly assumption like that?	1
5770619	f- what I was I was...	1
6460312	That's pretty much identical to what we have involved in this case.	1
2941914	Well, do you agree with your opponents here on at least some of the ground rules that would suffice?	1
738161	I mean, it's just you're asking us to reach beyond the confines of this case in doing that.	1
3986811	Uh-huh.	1
2564322	He pays it in January instead of December.	1
8149756	In fact, it's my second point. Well, I I...	1
1009741	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
274910	Well, in one sense, though, the act does regulate use of the information by both the States and private parties into whose hands the information comes.	0
5268461	I think his answer...	1
1913204	Well, first -- first of all, my view is that it is not a procedural due process violation.	0
1023396	So for instance, a stop might reasonably take longer if there are more people in the car so that the officer has to check the the criminal histories of more people in the car.	0
8421502	What about the provision of the Restatement, which came out, I guess, in 1932?	1
7849533	Is that--	1
7263382	Well, would you state what you think the test is, without being so fact-specific?	1
1565103	Thank you.	0
3842265	[Laughter]	1
4037251	She said...	1
1532088	That's fine.	0
9151204	That's the rule.	1
168145	I didn't know that's what we had done.	1
7792053	So I think that's a different case.	1
1791983	And it doesn't take into account how he stops--	0
1680437	But we didn't apply the statute literally there.	0
8712760	Well, the commission has...	1
1161023	What is the source of... of law for our decision?	1
2087555	[Inaudible]	1
3381093	And they, but the the the likelihood...	1
2459081	Who has the burden of proof on the immunity here?	1
2188095	What makes it look like a...	1
6097870	Who would have thought that?	1
1122341	What does that include?	0
860858	[Laughter]	1
3755032	But they could.	1
8330224	Who found that the notice of appeal hadn't been signed?	1
1967377	Mr. Haberbush, would you be able, after the argument, to furnish the Court with the places in the record available to us where it shows that you raised the State statute of limitations issue below?	0
577054	That stretches it pretty thin, pretty thin.	1
2134624	Am I right?	1
5094941	--And what are we to make of that?	1
6678105	Could the prime make the same argument, constitutional argument that you're making on behalf of the sub?	1
4878825	for their...	1
9361707	Where?	1
572603	You don't agree that if there's a consensus, then the Eighth Amendment would bar it.	1
5583822	If there are no further questions, Mr. Chief Justice--	1
958076	--Well, so that makes the officer's sequencing decision entirely dispositive of whether the dog sniff can occur.	0
447735	Was there a proceeding available in Virginia whereby this defendant, post conviction, could have determined... had the facts determined?	0
999693	Are they in effect yet?	0
5635945	remains seve-	1
6842737	See, it's a line they draw between points.	1
