417721	I'm not... I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
1548521	But in this context, perhaps we should not import public forum analysis.	0
1915816	And so from the individual's perspective, her interest in -- it's the same in avoiding the dog sniff as it is in avoiding a warrant check or any other incident of a stop.	0
107339	Well, Mr. Roberts, do they in Alaska have to go personally or not?	1
5802098	that is not a tax...	1
605004	--But you don't weigh future dangerousness against that as you put it.	1
84744	And so what... in your view, the nursing homes have to wait for a deficiency citation?	0
1095453	Well, there's certainly no ex post facto problem there, is there?	1
4634860	quintessential...	1
1955518	I think once the Court said in Caballes that -- that it is permissible in some circumstances to perform a dog sniff during a traffic stop, then--	0
8382429	Or maybe another house that...	1
373707	But AT&T didn't bring an antitrust action.	0
7344192	We can say you've changed the law and therefore it's ex post facto, but we don't decide for ourselves over the... overruling a State court what that particular law said at a particular time.	1
9381976	[Laughter]	1
5525980	Why, in answer to Justice Ginsburg, does the government take the view it does?	1
6337049	It might violate some other clause like the substantive due process.	1
7097756	Miss -- Miss Brink --	1
8117778	I am sure the other side says that the code does not eliminate any cause of action that the sub has against the prime.	1
2032992	[Laughter]	1
4702588	Now, that happens not... that happens not to help the respondent here.	1
1378173	What would have happened if the disclosure about Albuterol was made before the company announced revenue shortfalls?	1
1622489	We have a different system that we think works as well.	0
9048077	--and... and upset what's going on all across the country?	1
4655921	Now, the Ninth Circuit seems to have applied some kind of a per se rule.	1
7734464	Well, but that... doesn't that sort of beg the question?	1
2304607	And several circuits have allowed the All Writs Act to be used in this fashion, do you think?	0
438820	How... how is it possible then that that section has any effect on any preemption affected by PWSA or the other... or PTSA?	0
3612210	On what basis?	1
2629139	I... I think weren't there about four relatives who testified?	1
7666536	[Laughter]	1
9208805	Thank you.	1
2312134	expected?	0
7435784	Is that still before us?	1
1132668	I don't know why you have to go on with this, has to be adjudicated on the merits argument.	1
664037	Is it the burden of the State, if they're going to use shackles, to somehow establish that it's needed?	0
8070611	How is there State action?	1
8605970	there's...	1
7073512	is a collateral attack, the employee says, look, I filed a grievance and it's pending, what then is the burden of proof by the Government employer?	1
1230382	Because that one is not very attractive.	0
5614728	I mean, it's rather crucial to your case.	1
4473955	[Laughter]	1
8154530	and on this...	1
6999711	So, it's hard to look at it as a field preemption case.	1
6411729	Because it doesn't make any difference.	1
119240	--If it is the end of the traffic stop, it is not.	0
2316633	The trunk of the vehicle did not have to be opened here.	0
444597	Do you take the position that you can file a suit against the tribe?	1
9230952	Every one of these contracts says the arbitrator will follow the law, the arbitrator has no power to commit errors of law.	1
4167772	rules required.	1
5581691	Okay but that's, I mean, that may be a very good argument to Congress, maybe a dangerous argument because the soft money opponents may find something to run with there, but I'm not sure that it's an argument, and I realize you were asked to get into this, but I'm not sure that it's an argument that's going to help us decide this case.	1
7996999	Would... would your client fall under little (i) as a result of what happened?	1
6446040	Who would have thought that?	1
5192675	And certainly I think... I agree with Justice O'Connor.	1
1574877	Those have been Establishment Clause challenges, and we had a...  the Witters case from your state, and determined that the Establishment Clause is not violated by giving aid to the blind, which is used then to study for the ministry, right?	0
8573807	Well, does this district have the authority to so provide for its own purchases?	1
5218539	If if there were some other legal proceeding.	1
1906358	that is not a tax...	1
2204403	Well, let me ask you, if we think they're right, and if we were to opt for what the majority of the courts of appeals have held, then could this applicant have developed a factual basis in State proceedings in Virginia?	0
124287	And the State's own expert said in Mr. Crane's trial that approximately seventy-five percent of the prison population has antisocial personality disorder.	0
8017049	But presumably for the hotels that are not on fee land, at least, they are not... the guests are not paying a state tax or a county tax.	1
8342980	--explain that to me?	1
6390978	Right.	1
923747	Is that the majority view of lower courts today?	0
1604414	Okay--	1
2223615	I'm worried about the implications there for the compliance by a state with a mandate of the Supreme Court and that's what I'd like you to think through for me.	1
9654812	--Mr.... yes, Mr. Olson.	1
4251927	Absolutely not.	1
563794	--be a QDRO, though?	1
521214	Do we know?	1
3756730	The official capacity suits have been dropped.	1
7242998	arbitrator. The...	1
5835718	Now I'll tell you how you give me $76,000 more.	1
1120150	all right.	0
6455751	There are no such cases.	1
4341964	I mean, a lot of people have to go in and report different things, send in forms, give their pictures, even give their fingerprints.	1
195974	But the normal rules of retroactivity do not apply uniformly to every matter governed by a statute.	1
261119	The defendant understood that he would receive a sentence of 15 years to life.	0
2153268	You're saying, then, that when the AEDPA says constitutional right it really means any sort of a right claimed under a Federal statute?	1
1873895	Well, what if the coal miner digs into the coal and in the process releases this gas that you say the petitioner owns?	1
7608798	not?	1
5214757	Isn't that a status?	1
1960422	--by the state.	0
7039987	But as a practical matter, what would happen to the coal miners who are trying to take out the coal and at the same time releasing gas, if your position is correct?	1
6266072	On the other hand, if your position is right, then this association, where most of the members are public school principals, can decide as far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, we don't want to have any teams for girls.	1
9241494	Would the court be wrong to say that there's a quasi... would the court be wrong to say there's a quasi suspect class here, or suspect class?	1
2375732	Well, but I mean, I--	1
1436595	What's the court going to do then, and yet here's a personal jurisdiction issue just sitting there, right there, that the court could decide.	0
2350519	That's correct,	1
7886778	It's a perfectly plausible alternative forum.	1
9211718	that's not the case with question one.	1
6582830	We now have...	1
142323	Isn't that the consequence of your position?	1
637092	Then you have 30 days or whatever it is to go to the court of appeals.	0
8443126	--I mean, just while you were on the jurisdictional mysticism of, you know, whether it dissolves or where the jurisdiction is, as I read this, and tell me if this is correct or not, whether it supports you or not, I want to know if it is right.	1
7162746	And I have to say even as a threshold matter, I don't know why that implies an economic criterion in some different way than a reference to or a different degree than a reference to individual health would do.	1
2108603	And you're talking now about post eligibility?	0
5002553	Mr. Porter, I don't think that on its face it says that.	1
1847551	Well, in the post-conviction proceeding, as I recall, what was raised was ineffective assistance of counsel primarily.	0
2174387	I thought you said it turned on the date of the award, regardless of when the work was performed.	0
2527539	and coming back and...	1
5378996	Now, what's the answer?	1
530577	I think in the cases it takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds to do a dog sniff.	0
5342884	[Laughter]	1
8670498	All right.	1
1306429	But my experience... if I understand you correctly, it would be relevant... it seems to me the vast percentage, maybe the overwhelming percentage of cases on appeal in habeas proceedings do have to do with procedural issues, whether there was an adequate State ground, whether there's a basis for new evidence and therefore you're excused from not raising the claim before, things like that, and your position is that all those, you can't get a COA at all.	1
3046335	I suppose the most likely scenario for significant contribution would be the notion that I will give this money, and expect in return that if and when I ever call this particular official, if the official is elected, they'll pay attention to me.	1
2225873	--that there could be a claim based on design defect, that there could be a claim saying there were off-label oral statements made that amounted to fraud or misleading--	1
871947	It is property, before it's asserted.	1
7379456	So we have to decide that, do we?	1
320311	And since that is the case, I think that the officer can incrementally extend the stop so long as the ultimate duration of the stop is--	0
4494718	No, but seriously, I mean, what... how could that standard ever be satisfied in the case Justice Breyer gave you, except on... you know, some silly assumption like that?	1
6239229	an objection to the --	1
8206518	Well... well, is that rational basis review the one we would employ in reviewing legislation passed by Congress concerning immigration policy?	1
9475448	--so I assume the analogy is exact.	1
428279	Well, does the right to association while in prison survive in some form, do you think?	0
4559935	worth of wages.	1
7628935	lesser included offense.	1
724692	The idea that this country when it...  when it provides tax exemptions or cash to citizens to educate their children, cannot single out for discriminatory treatment the Catholic or the religious person is not a far-reaching...  well, it may have been far-reaching at the time, and thank heavens that it is, that this principle as the...  I think one of the questions, I think it was Justice O'Connor's question, asked with respect to the funding cases and this Court dealt specifically with that in the Maher v. Roe case when it said the funding cases do not control the significantly different context in which a funding decision impinges upon the constitutionally-imposed government obligation of neutrality required by the religion clauses.	1
3409775	no limit on what they can do here.	1
4526801	They're taxed differently.	1
9002084	If they had a policy of not prosecuting minimal amounts of possession of marijuana, then I take it, it would or would not be reasonable to go in?	1
7367430	Why?	1
53948	And is it open to us, in the habeas context, to take a narrow view of that?	1
1748444	The State law does not prohibit that?	1
2097052	are...	1
8142948	to u-	1
5180060	But in order to say the number is no good, you're still challenging something which, at least on its face, has been authorized by FERC.	1
5751827	I just thought it was a little curious that if some means of solving this had been offered, why we're here.	1
7680541	[Laughter]	1
2800952	Have they ever represented that they did, in fact, comply with the statutes concerning the level of compensation?	1
1685205	party's contract...	1
9195081	And then if you win, instead of $4,000, he could take $80,000 through the party.	1
6588681	But all you are telling me, General, is that... is that there are... there are reasons why one would pick the higher levels and not pick the lower levels.	1
4503453	which they might prefer to do.	1
4939533	court of appeal...	1
8772501	Well, that doesn't shrink the jurisdiction.	1
7210788	filed...	1
27217	May I ask whether you think your client was a State actor before... 1995, was it, they changed the rules?	1
4232477	Well, I'm not sure it is.	1
2198285	I'm not saying legitimate or not, but in my own mind, I thought the relevant distinction turned on taking the area previously available for advertising.	1
2042635	The...	1
5909919	But you said they couldn't do that on remand.	1
6199543	If you file a notice of appeal, a brand new case starts in the court of appeals.	1
149548	And it -- it is also fair to the plaintiff to be able to pursue this claim, these claims, some of which have nothing to do with the outcome.	0
2008575	Well, in... in Batson, I guess the opinion for the Court suggested that it was basing it on the title VII cases, the McDonnell Douglas formula.	0
2929348	This part of your argument it seems to me contradicts your first.	1
5814207	because the British...	1
4986136	We had been.	1
1361967	It is used in -- in the appropriate cases.	0
6640132	And would it be a reasonable set back requirement, I suppose it would, but you'd still say it would be a taking.	1
1986667	Now, what's the response to that?	1
786739	First, where the defendant inquires about appeal rights, and then secondly where there are circumstances indicating the defendant may benefit from such advice.	0
3418798	or adult motels.	1
524698	The statute has to be narrowly tailored, we contend, but at least closely drawn to pursue the Federal interest.	1
6937190	What you seem to be asking is to infer from that treaty that the prior unlawful land sales of the Oneida's New York reservations were somehow ratified.	1
1246542	defendants under those circumstances.	1
2325782	All right, so if you assume a Senate race that costs $4 million, let's say, the difference would be between whether you had to find 50 willing donors with families or a thousand.	1
3050744	Thank you.	1
6232194	Maybe it wasn't an Estelle v Smith violation at all.	1
6842319	I'm assuming they exist.	1
7781970	And I thought that we had to address this facial challenge insofar as it affects the new policy.	1
6788894	until his...	1
2439371	Yes, and I also have it in on page twelve of the joint appendix.	1
3190233	The contingence fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by the recovery on--	1
243025	And if the judge feels that, whoa, you know, we better hold things up here because there is a direct conflict and one party may be prejudiced if they continue at the same time, I -- I think that's really where the analysis is. So, basically, the -- the Petitioner is asking the Court, I know my malicious prosecution case has been dismissed, but I want you to review this claim as though it was a malicious prosecution claim.	0
2116012	May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips?	0
4224328	[Laughter]	1
3515925	I mean, is it enough to cite a Federal constitutional provision or a Federal statute or other provision describing the right as Federal?	1
6665081	Then the irrationality apparently started with this Court.	1
172733	And so should we apply that test here to those early statements?	0
2347492	--I don't see how the Sixth Circuit judgment can stand in light of Murray v. Carrier.	0
3271064	Could the State ban adults from receiving advertising of that sort?	1
4071693	or that...	1
7340859	What about a forum selection clause?	1
1057374	It's not clear to me at all.	0
8470862	Mr. Hundley, you have 2 minutes remaining.	1
845455	consensus...	1
9591552	Well, but of course the evidence of dangerousness is perhaps more precise than the mitigating evidence.	1
7373466	going to do?	1
4639259	Yeah, but the Court went on to say that this was a free exercise violation as well as a First Amendment violation.	1
1327275	You mean you say the answer is to let the party tell the voters before the primary election which candidate they support?	0
9059992	As defined in the statute.	1
387096	This... the trunk of the car didn't have to be opened here.	0
2067342	and are reasonable, they must be withheld -- upheld.	1
1088884	I mean, there are situations in cases -- we cited this in Footnote 20 of our brief where you have the dog arriving just as the officer is about to give the ticket.	0
105967	Now, the prisoner says no, I don't want to participate in that program.	0
2979686	--based on the information that they had?	1
5167620	Well, I think we may be playing with words.	1
8439012	It might be useful to say they were wrong in--	1
2162628	Well...	0
4026241	I would have thought it was proceeding on the designated broker theory.	1
5400699	You say no, it doesn't.	1
6926710	Well, so there was a suspicion of that back in '80?	1
7348411	And it's not a brief of yours, and by what authority did you file it, if I may ask?	1
2090093	Should we certify a question back to the California Supreme Court and say, was this a reasonable time?	0
151621	Well, maybe they did, but is it not the case that we normally defer to courts of appeals on questions of state law on issues of standing?	0
2256726	He must be diligent going towards the investigation of the traffic stop.	0
2189924	A backwards looking assessment--	1
1671010	Other courts have?	0
3547779	[Laughter]	1
7918962	Rodgers where the...	1
3002972	Would it be enforceable or not?	1
1164365	--what we suggested in Chickasaw Nation.	1
1080053	Well, I guess the court, the Sixth Circuit pulled that out of Qualitex' opinion.	0
7280583	I don't want to consume your...	1
2781983	Can you just not want to have anything to do with them?	1
2146199	who had not been convicted of crimes and who had not been placed on probation.	1
1342954	If I...	1
807957	Isn't that the other element?	0
2686150	another worker.	1
2009545	Well, but let's suppose it wants to establish a standard to apply now and in the future for itself and for any other jurisdiction, public jurisdiction, within its area?	0
4694996	Is there such a price today that could be paid if a farmer were to go out and buy water from another farmer who had some?	1
3755283	absolutely.	1
5777318	--so I assume the analogy is exact.	1
2381233	And he's at level three?	0
2672997	So fact limits what is... what can be considered as conceivable.	1
6134007	Throughout your opening brief, you never referred to that statute.	1
542732	Well, you have... you've answered these questions with some qualification.	1
240691	You shouldn't use elements from a discrete 1983 case to assess the validity of an independent and discrete 1983 case. So I think that because of this tortured argument importing unrelated elements merely to salvage a time-barred case, it defaces the -- the -- the Petitioner's claim, transforming it into something else.	0
4316561	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.	1
1014274	But it's not recognized in the Federal statute or in the regulations.	0
3562308	No other State does that.	1
8433857	With respect to a party not being named at all.	1
6357427	fifty-eight A thirty-one twenty is where thirty-one twenty-one Q appears, and remember that is a section that provides definitions.	1
3233278	interpretation does.	1
8974344	basis for infal-	1
6157632	It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market.	1
5633367	It's a kind of garnishment, I guess, and that's what makes it a little different from the ordinary contract case.	1
2383856	Do... do beneficiaries of SSI funds have a Federal right that they can enforce through a section 1983 action to have the representative payee act in their best interests?	0
4402695	where...	1
8713601	That's what I want to know.	1
8297515	Your answer is yes.	1
7131682	But do you agree that the... even if two parochial schools were playing each other?	1
8343564	I mean, that's not the way we analyze contracts.	1
1459555	Has the State paid the attorney's fees up to that date?	0
289142	timely objected.	1
9108330	Why should Kansas be rewarded with interest for that delay, even if it was not undue?	1
133095	Is there anything in the record--	1
4814506	You're both in agreement that would do?	1
4121949	one part --	1
6891991	Mr. Roberts, on that point you said this is truthful information, and it is.	1
907609	history...	1
9144397	We so held in Karcher, the Karcher case from New Jersey, didn't we?	1
8937044	How about coal?	1
4571120	He's relying on... that's why you have an expert witness, to some extent, upon the credibility of the expert witness.	1
1964517	Do you concede that the statute is valid as to the limitation on addresses of crime victims?	0
6027709	Well, I thought we'd held in Allied-Signal that it violates the Due Process Clause--	1
154166	Isn't it there also an efficiency in just sending it back for new trial right away, rather than going through all of the other claimed errors?	1
614282	Yeah, it's the highway department purchasers.	1
1107591	can happen. And...	1
1900881	What we have is a system that allows a reasonable time.	0
5116526	Well, that's true.	1
2021069	And on that, do we look at the whole State and what would happen overall, or do we just focus on individual legislative senatorial districts?	0
9288210	All right.	1
7233931	Well--	1
1286271	Yes.	0
5334773	Yes, Your Honor.	1
9550217	[Laughter]	1
1587303	They set up some procedures, you don't like them... sorry.	1
304236	Is that your position?	1
7125077	So I mean, your... your position, as I understand it, is that... that this determinant point is not necessary to satisfy the delegation doctrine, and the... and as you have just said, the question of reasonableness or capriciousness is not before us because it was never reached by the court below.	1
1929048	So in this case, there were no arguable grounds for appeal, so counsel had no duty to advise of appeal rights.	0
5475585	Yes.	1
287322	Because it is a...  it is...	1
8517819	You're--	1
6135872	So that's nice and administratively convenient.	1
486931	And what basic responsibility does that entail, would you say, the fact that the Government is a trustee?	0
8756216	[Laughter]	1
5350288	worker...	1
8681986	But you think it's basically the land encompassed in blue.	1
765297	I thought there was something in the agreement.	1
4172391	--as applied to this case.	1
6154352	[Laughter]	1
2339543	As far as as...	0
1968051	--under 1983?	0
1840285	The tax in...	1
3858661	All right.	1
3042459	And moreover, there's a crack in the canal, so that means most of the time the water that's running out is water that would be there for irrigation, and some of the time the water that runs out through the crack is water that would be... would have been released because there was too much water behind the dam and the San Joaquin River was filled up.	1
5119201	Well, Mr. Olson, isn't Section 5 sort of a safe harbor provision for states, and do you think that it gives some independent right of a candidate to overturn a Florida decision based on that section?	1
6551674	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
706315	And we're going to have to take every State case subject to fact determinations made by the State courts, and that's going to limit the application of this conceivable rational basis test.	1
1609236	I...  I respectfully submit that it is, that the students in the Rosenberger that were publishing those articles were publishing articles that advocated belief in God.	1
8299765	--I think to paint the picture that we're talking about, just pure speech is... is not the case.	1
6192454	case.	1
3777323	But in part, it seems to me that there are many indicia of punishment here as well.	1
2841136	And I I would not disagree with that.	1
3976103	But this--	1
3410617	[Laughter]	1
189305	That reference to jurisdiction thereof has to mean jurisdiction to enter judgment on an arbitration award.	1
6330486	Yes.	1
9075090	--shaved your beard or something.	1
3316923	Defendant and his counsel say okay.	1
3199195	Now, is...	1
8917845	Yes.	1
952423	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.	1
9126070	Would you say generally do not apply?	1
634833	Also, I found that portion of the transcript where the defendant was advised of the sentence.	0
521435	Well, the court had three different opportunities to take up Mr. Fiore's case presumably.	0
276925	I guess that isn't...	0
5301509	--and trial counsel was able to explain to the trial court the basis of its decision, and from trial counsel's explanation, one could determine that it wasn't based on a strategic rationale, but instead was based simply on a misunderstanding of the time, of the timeliness of the rejection rule that was at issue.	1
7474259	Number tw--	1
620275	But it would probably be even better if we set it at zero.	1
9140756	What we... what we know is that 19 States... it was 20 at the time we filed our brief, but it's now 19, follow the cause in prejudice approach and require the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and there's at least a significant number of States that don't require the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, but it's unclear whether there's more than 20, and so we don't know exactly whether it's a majority or not, but... but there at least are a significant number that apply procedural default principles to the raising of claims on direct appeal, and that's--	1
8636829	But the claims that he brought were constitutional claims, so one could surely read this subsection (c) of section 2253 to mean that even if you could surmount the procedural hurdle of adequate, independent State grounds, still you don't get a certificate of appealability unless you show that you had made a claim about what went on in the State criminal proceedings of the denial of a constitutional right.	1
4629858	But are we talking about actions that constitute the commission of some kind of criminal offense in the process?	1
3878124	Mr. Minnis, the picture here is that a tribe selects out a certain form contract to present to the other side.	1
2983083	If money is made available for individuals in the Medicare program to exclude people that want to go to religious hospitals for their heart surgery, that would violate the Free Exercise Clause.	1
7145241	Well, are you... I take it that all you really want us to do here is to say that the Ninth Circuit test, not-wholly-unrelated test, either is a matter of substance or is a matter of creating a presumption in applying the James test, went beyond James, and that we ought to reverse or vacate because that erroneous standard was applied, and I take it that you don't really need to have us or want us necessarily to do anything more at this stage except send it back and say, apply James the way we wrote James, and then if you don't like it later, maybe there'll be another appeal, but am I right that that's all you really want us to do, is to say that not-wholly-unrelated goes beyond James?	1
2252493	There's no evidence that they intended this scheme to be advisory.	1
6033329	Just write the check to the party, and I'll keep a tally, and so do they.	1
1286959	Does that have a bearing on this?	0
8192509	He could not say that with respect to the areas covered by the agreement.	1
8312456	objecting to a distinction between classes of...	1
4300220	teacher recording and making...	1
3417120	So, what is your answer to that?	1
1184854	But in Whren, the stated reason for the stop, traffic enforcement, was lawful, and we didn't have to look any further.	0
7875366	--Kennedy gave you, why isn't that covered by the QDRO section--	1
5444274	[Laughter]	1
7263654	There was a form five that was verified.	1
801899	That's not...	1
2153619	Mr. Wallace, I... do you agree that under the board's rule here that it does allow the board to find the unfair labor practice and impose the sanctions on litigation brought by employers that is not limited to just shams and abuse of process?	1
6492529	Let... let me talk about what we have before us here for just a minute.	1
531430	prison situation.	1
9399021	Thank you, Mr. Roberts.	1
4771876	[Laughter]	1
1758785	Yes.	1
4131845	that they weren't...	1
5711614	Well--	1
1714240	Do you think there's a difference at all in application of such a policy to commercial entities and groups, as opposed to private membership groups?	1
4750683	There are three different kinds of funding programs going on?	1
6315520	So Mr. Phillips was right, then, in his statement to me that there had been no technological change during that period of time.	1
6232775	no limit on what they can do here.	1
4763929	That we can let you do after the thirty days.	1
2698662	I don't understand--	1
1803562	If, in fact, you go beyond the -- the -- the traffic stop even measurably beyond it, then you have violated the -- the -- the driver's rights, and it is unconstitutional.	0
1868840	and coming back and...	1
8510923	properly, sir.	1
1802311	shops.	0
793533	Whose interests are we looking at, those of the contributor or those of the candidate, or both?	0
6540447	Thank you, Mr. Jones.	1
5279329	impairment --	1
4308378	change?	1
176801	It sure is.	0
1599329	Let... let me talk about what we have before us here for just a minute.	1
271892	--or not?	0
8177386	I mean, that's...  that's as old as the country itself, isn't it?	1
9057979	long...	1
1547343	Yes.	1
2047686	Well, actually, there is no evidence in the record on whether the individual employees were audited or not.	0
596563	Well, we're talking here about fruits, the location of the gun and the gun.	1
5147805	As I understand, the riverboats wouldn't make money either if they didn't have the slot machines.	1
4943341	You mentioned, or Justice Kennedy earlier mentioned some problems that the trier of fact would have.	1
2950803	which they might prefer to do.	1
2359590	It--	0
5572321	What are the factors in Missouri that the State would be trying to prove to urge the imposition of death versus life imprisonment?	1
602845	--Unless the pondering is to avoid the diligence, and that would be the question.	0
8770848	home searches...	1
9603673	which they might prefer to do.	1
4113591	The Congress then was giving away public lands and was giving away public minerals.	1
1492737	--No, I'm sorry.	1
2397063	And so we think that if the officer is able to do a dog sniff within a reasonable time, and still is reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic stop violation, it ought to be constitutionally permissible.	0
4374339	The... the statute says, pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause.	1
4333374	--the wages?	1
9334080	If it doesn't, then it seems that we would have to look to Erie and to Hannah.	1
4459813	So the fact that they may not have been able to prove the precise predicate, which is the modeling predicate for the computation of money damages now, doesn't prove that they shouldn't have sued earlier.	1
8045279	But presumably for the hotels that are not on fee land, at least, they are not... the guests are not paying a state tax or a county tax.	1
923668	We were assuming that the parties spending money on gun control advertising, after consulting with the candidate about that, is not a coordinated expense, so the party would be able to do it.	1
5643158	Counsel, would you mind telling us why it matters which rule is followed by a State, resource for first or income first, not just in an individual case, but overall? Who who saves what in terms of money if you do one thing or the other?	1
1451618	Is that a jurisdictional defect or is it not?	1
1597261	Well, do you think that on the facts of this particular case there might be some necessity to go back and review them?	0
2842883	That wouldn't do it?	1
1810877	Weren't... weren't there some other questions here, like didn't we grant cert on three questions--	1
44620	Why?	1
3394482	before the grand jury.	1
2150761	Is that right?	1
7249428	It is...  it is derivatively obtained information.	1
6568789	Are they appointed or elected?	1
1457303	Okay.	1
1262652	Isn't that the end of the delegation issue?	1
263883	re-offend.	1
9050079	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.	1
1157302	He felt... the district court said only that Agent Cantu felt the bag, so we really don't know what's involved, more than the passenger shoving it around situation.	0
544666	And the magistrate had a question as to the credibility of this witness, and if you have a question as to the credibility of the witness then there is not sufficient facts to able to make a determination as to whether in fact there is probable cause.	0
5541907	The two dates, or the findings with respect to the two dates struck me as being at least possibly in tension.	1
8007080	Thank you, Mr. Bell.	1
5043200	How could Colorado have known about prejudgment interest in an interstate compact dispute?	1
1701607	Codify what?	1
8428239	Yes, but he gets a 15-percent override or something like that, doesn't he?	1
9580314	Well, what if the arresting officer just doesn't give a reason for the arrest, just makes the arrest, and it turns out, at the end of the day, that indeed there were objective facts that would have justified an arrest.	1
8139063	There's one thing on the question of how far the compound interest could compound that I don't understand, and I was... I want to ask the other side the same question, but maybe you can explain it.	1
117895	Yes, and wouldn't that routinely show up something like this, or--	0
1239227	--I would have thought it was fairly fundamental under due process that you have to have a complaint that names the party, and serve the party with process.	1
6254057	These petitioners are not part of the agreement?	1
5437060	require...	1
408514	They're suspicious.	1
87204	Is the claim a First Amendment claim or what?	1
5803058	In other words, reasonable probability.	1
1773255	--The courts -- courts asserted--	0
32683	Is that not before us?	0
1902519	Well--	0
2303374	And -- and I -- I think we --	0
1752180	Then there's no more justification.	0
4132375	Is it still coal under your theory?	1
2014122	I don't have the exact --	1
1107918	You haven't interrupted anybody.	1
9189300	quintessential...	1
323981	But then... then you might--	1
1570964	I...	0
5659534	--Yes.	1
6976217	Amendment rule in the prison system...	1
3146697	That seems to be--	1
5264041	Well, Mr. Roberts.	1
1953924	Why don't we assume that, as a fact.	1
494351	What if--	0
8992230	been m- making these assessments, please,	1
72762	Well, certainly in the civil-case context, generally, the interpretation has been pretty broad.	1
7767684	Correct.	1
5980378	The people that depend...  that aren't the Warren Buffetts, that depend upon the integrity of the system, are the ones that are going to be most vulnerable if the Eleventh Circuit decision is upheld.	1
1200311	I mean, where does that come from?	0
1846962	That can be waived.	0
1878981	Well, let me--	0
8174260	There was no provision for a hearing in effect at the time this case arose?	1
6587895	Were these findings by Congress?	1
34425	Surely that's not right.	1
2328370	I'm asking you how we determine what is a reasonable time.	0
9488213	anything less...	1
417735	I mean, that was an important governmental interest.	1
7588037	--you do agree, do you not, that the Government does not agree with you on this point?	1
903420	the reverse...	1
7789461	Has that been determined...	1
5685926	because you didn't sign it, right?	1
6546742	Well, that could be the case, but I still have my question, if there are other examples...	1
4333828	States de-	1
1469063	If a challenge is brought to the use of lethal injection as a method of execution, how must that be brought?	0
536031	But why?	1
1564999	Well, and that has a textual support in the constitutional language itself.	0
3612902	I mean, people from Kansas never go to Colorado?	1
2870106	correct.	1
286727	Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate?	0
4976511	speculate. We...	1
2738251	That's what I want to know.	1
1732874	Has that happened--	0
9047171	Yes.	1
8077360	And sometimes if the safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great, I understood at least, that could affect the decisions.	1
6713623	discussing. Th-	1
551216	Is that not the kind of thing that courts have looked at and determined whether that's a valid public policy or not?	0
155964	Correct, Your Honor.	0
4523797	--I would think that the latter means, even if it becomes final in some other fashion.	1
7536789	The indications are it's not.	1
1747916	[Laughter]	1
683053	tips on there.	1
2221676	--No, that's -- no.	0
6893644	on the credit card...	1
4728457	Now, there is an ongoing 1983 class action, is there, covering this very facility?	1
5726166	Thank you.	1
5117585	think it is.	1
8333395	It's not as if...	1
946019	Well, what about the protection of crime victims?	0
708647	And you don't prevent them from...	1
2524502	Well, Ms. Brinkmann, th-	1
5281138	Was that, in effect, pure in Nevada?	1
2535795	Well, if there are 35 buildings on the premises, how many did the Government use since 1960?	1
4260240	[Laughter]	1
7332474	inconsistencies.	1
9545845	That is, suppose somebody is a pickpocket and you have a list and say, pickpockets have to register, the same thing as here.	1
5913595	Is the effects test used to impeach the finding that the legislature had a regulatory intent?	1
4407535	May I ask, under the Second Circuit rule, if the defendant is represented by the Public Defender's Office in the trial court, and then on appeal, the Public Defender's Office continues to represent him but by a different lawyer, they have different... does that... is that a different lawyer within the meaning of the Second Circuit rule, or is it the same lawyer?	1
1570155	Yes, right.	1
8817422	And that's similar to the kind of interpretation the Court had to face in Edelman, isn't it?	1
9400517	I... I don't know that viewing it through the lens of a constructive discharge is helpful.	1
1731292	--Well, so that makes the officer's sequencing decision entirely dispositive of whether the dog sniff can occur.	0
1972479	But it's very--	0
2345145	under under manual tasks?	1
2127988	Is that the context in which we've articulated that rule?	0
7356944	at the...	1
7479105	Is it the commerce clause?	1
3612422	So that this rule, to the extent that it requires a full-time employee, does apply to private schools as well.	1
2282340	If it's a failure to test, if it's a... a design defect requirement, if it's an off-labeled, false misrepresentation, why are they preempted?	1
4234013	But that can't be the whole rule.	1
645016	section...	1
1894812	--Well, so that makes the officer's sequencing decision entirely dispositive of whether the dog sniff can occur.	0
1183757	as the cause.	1
5625903	--as... as applied section 1738.	1
6383347	and when the least say...	1
1690924	I mean, Congress spoke pretty clearly there.	0
8842550	spouse...	1
6361436	Doesn't this statutory language leave that open?	1
1887097	Mr.... Mr. Kolbo, as a preliminary matter, would you address the question of whether the named plaintiff Patrick Hamacher has standing in this case.	0
1854129	Well, if we look at the language of the statute dealing with the final decision, we look at the fact that it was a dismissal, so we say, okay, there's jurisdiction.	0
9303644	don't...	1
912142	Well, that might affect the decision of whether they are seamen covered under the Jones Act.	0
3153751	Where do we go to read about this development in technology from 1909 to 1920?	1
5912474	Uh-huh.	1
8380667	--Did they make a deal to get what you say they are entitled to under (b)?	1
6931559	--So what is... isn't it a question of degree?	1
2134052	Could they not I  I'm imagining I just heard about...	0
8046645	Thank you.	1
2462772	Well, I think that the Pennsylvania supreme court did go further and say that a purpose of the enactment of this ordinance was to prevent unfortunate secondary effects such as an increase in sex crimes, am I right?	1
413079	Is that something the State is prepared to use first?	1
7219352	So it would help to focus on that.	1
2640228	and that's all. And...	1
7105786	Was that said in the Kiowa case?	1
1957694	--Yes.	0
1824013	Do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?	0
381463	Your point is neither the one nor the other can pay... has the right under the statute or under the... to pay these past debts for food, for example.	1
4459097	Where?	1
1173906	[Laughter]	1
4362898	Can we assume 20 acres of which 18 is wetlands?	1
4589056	It goes from 1727 to 1741.	1
1885198	Then I still--	1
1019782	That just seems so contrary to what Congress intended.	1
8367833	5(A).	1
2305437	Because the relator would have suffered an injury in fact?	1
6690012	Okay, but you've also got a finding which you seem to... I think you want to ignore here, that you should have known in '69.	1
4600260	On what basis?	1
7960547	local traffic...	1
378448	I'm not -- I'm not going to dispute that with you, Judge Ginsburg.	0
6775781	Right?	1
7502036	And...	1
6998511	functions.	1
1477443	Well, let me ask you this.	1
8029372	didn't he?	1
3840520	It may mean something different when you're talking about a state court and when you're talking about a Tribal Court.	1
5176402	Or something more?	1
675429	--I think when a traffic stop is occurring, when an officer has someone stopped, we don't expect them to ignore potential evidence of criminal behavior.	0
8258718	No, but seriously, I mean, what... how could that standard ever be satisfied in the case Justice Breyer gave you, except on... you know, some silly assumption like that?	1
2389316	When did the injury occur here to the respondent?	0
6287003	And doesn't that make a difference?	1
8795240	But does the subcontractor have a contractual right against the prime or not?	1
223671	And is it still done that way?	0
6701771	Miranda itself was from a State court.	1
7734657	And it says, the inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working.	1
1144479	But you don't mean it's easily... it's not--	0
2591783	[Laughter]	1
7329556	fifteen...	1
3739058	thing about...	1
5110403	Well, would you say that a ship coming in at a port in our country from elsewhere cannot be searched thoroughly without reasonable suspicion?	1
1758028	That has been an assertion that is unproven in the record.	0
3952470	What in that case, what statute were we interpreting?	1
521034	And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states.	1
2769058	Except if they heard so much of the evidence, isn't it unlikely that the jury thought they couldn't consider what they heard?	1
7729411	Is that your position?	1
2046952	That was not what...  yes, that's correct.	1
934854	--what the judgment on a different ground, this Court rarely takes submissions, even judicial notice submissions as a matter of first instance.	1
1087986	What's the answer to that?	1
4098673	The effect of the California provision would be to not allocate it at all.	1
1535630	And it would apply as to, what is it, the secondary standards--	1
6523850	So...	1
1618939	There'd be no problem, Mr. Chief Justice, if -- if, in fact, all of that was done before the traffic ticket was written.	0
7519758	I mean, what is... there are only to my knowledge Tribal Courts, federal courts, state courts, what else is there?	1
9034262	could be placed on probation without a willingness to be placed on probation? Is there no choice given to the...	1
5198331	In other respects it looks punitive.	1
295859	Do you concede that?	0
2904308	[Laughter]	1
1997154	Well, the Nix v. Williams case bears on it to some extent, doesn't it?	0
8769121	All right, but since 1925, I take it, it has been the common practice of the schools in Tennessee to engage in interscholastic athletic contests.	1
8857605	What we said in Penry One was that that is not necessarily clear to the jury, but we didn't say that it was irrational.	1
2225823	Well, in... in Batson, I guess the opinion for the Court suggested that it was basing it on the title VII cases, the McDonnell Douglas formula.	0
2139113	Then what the Government wants is yet another extension, and what Justice Breyer was proposing, and that is that any facility that is even used in part for flood control purposes, all the water passing through that facility, including the nonflood water part, becomes flood waters.	1
6907588	point...	1
2571522	required here. i- It would be in the regulations, Your Honor.	1
1023495	But Justice Stevens, it is an option that Congress understood was essential to the vitality of the statute.	1
529114	No, by now we're in the federal district court.	1
2807861	I'm not... I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
2674731	analysis...	1
9003840	Like Justice O'Connor, I'm inclined to think that the underlying... if the underlying claim is a denial of a constitutional right, it may suffice.	1
93404	disability has en-	1
7945838	Well, is it possible that showing consumer confusion could be considered by the court on the issue of what's the fair use?	1
135051	of choices.	1
5763454	Are any of the other provisions enforceable?	1
1768677	--I think when a traffic stop is occurring, when an officer has someone stopped, we don't expect them to ignore potential evidence of criminal behavior.	0
8595334	--Well, you would... you would concede that it is least ambiguous because the legislature said our purpose is regulatory.	1
7181906	And if so,	1
8641074	pro-	1
3095275	Oh, but as between State sovereigns, I mean, who is going to pay the bill in Colorado?	1
976788	Thank you, Mr. Gormley.	1
7802495	Would you still be here--	1
994550	I mean, why do you want to make it something else?	1
1982891	And in fact, did not defense counsel tell the jury for sentencing that they would be hearing evidence about the defendant's background--	0
6511206	I mean, why would the measure be specifically what each farmer would have lost in terms of dollars?	1
2228965	Well, this is the precise time when the party ought to be able to make its own selection for the spokesperson to run in the general election, to articulate the stand and the views that the party wants the voters to have a chance to hear.	0
7903920	I just want to get clear on the point that you and I discussed a minute ago on your exception to the Master's finding that you should have known in '69.	1
910712	I wanted to get your response if there's a chance.	1
3868720	Well, I just thought I--	1
1054176	Yes.	0
2098212	But under your scheme, I take it the highest tax rate for slot machine income at racetracks is 36 percent versus 20 percent for slot machines on riverboats.	0
8431979	And I doubt that this is the first... is this the first case in which they've said we... we follow Federal law on equal protection?	1
6139544	Back pay under...	1
7160833	information.	1
7152491	On the facts of this case, could the plaintiffs have gone to a court of competent jurisdiction and established an equal protection violation?	1
4023380	--for a State to tax--	1
8413583	Is there a Tribal Court?	1
4075586	These courts are simply powerless to entertain the case where one of the litigants is a non-member and the episode and suit occurred off reservation, you started out, are you abandoning that position?	1
8353674	Oh, if... if you applied the Russello presumption here, you... you would be applying the presumption that I just described, namely in... in one section, it limited it, in... in the other section, it didn't limit it at all.	1
1448056	Would you say that that was a factor that ought to be considered, even though the membership was predominantly private?	1
6336878	Well, but that's not part of--	1
2222403	Don't you think the Doyle case cuts against your position somewhat?	1
132591	to save my husband's life?	1
3585514	"--But under this statute, with the safe-harbor provision in it, is it unlawful for her, as a lawyer, to say, ""You can destroy these documents""?"	1
789140	Well, it's a 12-week period.	1
4792410	So...	1
4667386	again what...	1
3558463	Which would mean that a fat cat industrialist bent on corrupting the candidate could write to the candidate a letter and say, you know, I'm giving $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee to spend on gun control issue advertising, which I am sure will help your campaign.	1
8846529	No.	1
7284504	I didn't understand your answer to Justice Breyer.	1
7229494	Well, certainly it doesn't...	1
8121771	And it... it just... if the closely related offense doctrine has the effect of punishing an officer for explaining to the suspect a reason for the arrest, why is that a good doctrine?	1
7824400	Oh.	1
8643900	be a tip. There...	1
2295672	And did not ask for summary judgment on the issue of whether the respondent was disabled.	1
3894930	[Laughter]	1
6380331	Well, what do the annual...	1
2779266	but...	1
9374988	I mean, I think that's what we need to look at.	1
9356838	to u-	1
560346	That's the fiction.	1
6788658	It... it would invite endless hearings.	1
279008	Okay.	1
147092	General Underwood--	1
5731391	needs of prison administration.	1
6463209	be the same as for executing someone with a mental illness? We we have dealt with that, and and with the level of comprehension that someone must have in order to be eligible for the death penalty who has mental illness.	1
5221138	Why not?	1
1081347	Now, normally we would just defer to that, wouldn't we, and move on to the merits.	0
1153564	Yes, but that's possible to do.	0
2255418	That's how I would read it, too.	1
7696700	condition had not medically...	1
1939874	I don't see how we could possibly sustain that--	0
1227454	--And here the referendum failed.	1
7493222	The language about what they have to do to answer no, that at least ten jurors have to have a reasonable doubt as to the facts?	1
2553630	That's not the test.	1
1912558	Yes, but... against its consent.	1
621456	that the Kansas Supreme Court went too far.	1
3307480	I thought that's what you were doing.	1
1443911	I mean, it's just you're asking us to reach beyond the confines of this case in doing that.	1
6442855	Could the prime make the same argument, constitutional argument that you're making on behalf of the sub?	1
2330908	And that and that...	1
3199136	Well, let's say it falls on the guest.	1
4170957	Do you take the position that you can file a suit against the tribe?	1
2783096	--There, it is, it shows no esteem for the Commonwealth of Virginia regulating its own state elections to tell a national political party or anyone else that it must comply with Federal standards in order to participate in a purely state election activity when there are no Federal candidates on the ballot.	1
561691	I would think you would win under an objective test.	1
2660011	You're saying--	1
2240264	Well, in -- in the Second Circuit, the prudential stay has been in use for decades with no -- no untoward results. And --	0
4187203	Yeah, yeah, yeah.	1
6992873	If I had this agreement with a state, I would think that it might be limited to just the state court.	1
885155	But that hasn't been reviewed, as has been pointed out and--	0
6839320	If it's--	1
1426440	Was what?	0
7115744	--Includes--	1
9370781	I think that's just contrary to normal usage.	1
352552	That seems sort of inconsistent with your view on the second question that trial work periods shouldn't begin until the end of the twelve months.	0
1922616	That is the question of the case.	0
6388058	Well, could we talk about whether it's field preemption or conflict preemption or something else?	1
295325	But it's... it can be a very complicated question to know what time is left to make a State claim.	0
1494029	But I thought that was the whole basis that you've just given in your answer to justify what happened here.	1
301314	Well, now you're building in something that I didn't ask.	0
6506872	Yes, but that's the question here.	1
8662139	Then the term, as this Court has repeatedly said, those terms are relatively fixed and understood.	1
8589828	Could we talk about the facts of this case?	1
7444075	[Laughter]	1
170793	--That's right.	0
7058285	--but not willing to let the customs service do the same thing?	1
1469389	Well, you're just saying that if we decide the case in your favor, maybe Congress will do something equitable, but that certainly isn't the question before us.	1
2332151	It seems to me the strongest argument against that, and I haven't heard you assert it... maybe I should have asked this question of the Solicitor General, but it seems to me the strongest argument against it is, if you do look to the underlying claim and say, has there been a substantial showing in the underlying claim that a constitutional right was denied, it seems to me then, even if the procedural ground from which appeal is immediately sought is entirely clear, even though there's not much of a doubt about the correctness of the procedural ruling, you would have to... you would have to allow appeal.	1
8918061	And what are the other examples of Congress' choice to regulate States alone, exclusively under the Commerce Clause power, rather than general legislation?	1
2658822	Mr. Sutton w-	1
1232557	I don't want people knowing what my...	1
3195157	thirty...	1
2330971	talking about...	1
7858411	But, the standard forum selection clause?	1
9009462	That is, that there is not the same high recidivism rate for crimes generally that there is, apparently undisputedly, for sex crimes in the State of Alaska.	1
4954529	Mr. Phillips--	1
843907	Was that an alternative that was reasonable?	0
6876930	You... all you have to do is file a motion under this PLRA and say, we file a motion to terminate the ongoing relief.	1
9426622	So the Levin Amendment is not--	1
6770065	they weren't...	1
6974377	Well, sure.	1
3045354	And is that the number in the agreement, too?	1
743396	Here that wasn't done.	0
7169868	Well, I know that, but why shouldn't he have?	1
1297327	For life insurance proceeds, and even though it says the same exact words, does not... gross income does not include, we know that those do up the basis.	1
9473148	if you view the prior disciplinary action taken by the employer as final, subject only to some kind of collateral attack in a grievance procedure, then it is final unless, at the end of the day, the grievance procedure is successful.	1
4825888	consensus. Less than half.	1
4687420	It may mean something different when you're talking about a state court and when you're talking about a Tribal Court.	1
416661	have to --	1
2226636	Would it have preempted, in your view, the new one, the one we're talking about?	1
2710890	and the like.	1
6170375	element.	1
2084987	can charge...	0
7102635	It's only communication...	1
7753068	There you are.	1
1772283	It couldn't be clearer that the accident there occurred from flood waters, in the real sense of flood waters.	1
2993926	Thank you.	1
3453955	You think the answer to that is no, and I can't think of one.	1
2296207	Otherwise, why are we acting?	1
9048063	And in the Securities and Exchange Commission v. Universal Services, another one that my colleague referred to, page 234 of 106 F. 2d, at the end of 5 years there would be returned to each member an amount equal to total contributions plus 30 percent per annum.	1
5208281	--that was so clear to the parties at the time, and you say it is and... and what they... what they were anticipating is a change in the Federal--	1
1830338	From your perspective.	0
4721145	you really believe that...	1
2338968	Does that make a difference, particularly if the governmental unit itself takes the position that it would disagree with this determination that the Boy--	0
2537200	What did Utah do about radio and television advertising of cigarettes?	1
5075464	Very well, Mr. Pescetta.	1
940919	In that circumstance the question would be, are there circumstances indicating the defendant could benefit from appeal advice, and that question boils down to the issue of whether there were grounds, or more specifically arguable grounds for appeal.	0
5224900	--Well, maybe the answer is that there shouldn't be jurisdiction in either case if nobody signed anything.	1
4978357	We're just saying we can't touch the political process unless you get yourself into a suspect class.	1
2673550	Why?	1
7255197	But why isn't...	1
8769397	but   it's not the...	1
6470746	You say not precisely, you would not have any problem with saying that there's a taking if you have a set back requirement of 900 yards on a lot that is 901 yards wide.	1
5444993	Was that done here?	1
6495516	Miss -- Miss Brink --	1
4833575	So the penalty... it's the penalty.	1
5834134	I mean, I don't understand why we're using that term at all in light of the case background here.	1
6500735	And that gets... it gets you to the same point without having to use the... it seems to me a strange use of what's a case.	1
6404923	If it were different... if, for example... some counties around the country don't prosecute on cases like this, or maybe the quantity would have to be a little smaller.	1
2764544	[Laughter]	1
6069035	59a?	1
1053350	[Inaudible]	0
4608489	But I... but I do think that that's the more natural--	1
7776937	I mean...	1
1263860	And that's why I conclude that he -- that the Petitioner hasn't really set forth a discrete constitutional claim. Thank you.	0
8235767	What do we do with the Oneida II case decided in 1985?	1
7750120	Or a motorcycle?	1
1135660	Is that part of -- of the mission?	0
6374457	Your answer is it violates substantive due process or nothing.	1
126692	Here that wasn't done.	0
691868	Providing textbooks or other aid to religious schools.	0
5576831	Yeah, and one of their charges was possession, was it not?	1
6718332	The regulation specifically says the individual... the threat to the individual can be considered.	1
7979647	I mean, this is an appalling situation.	1
6442312	--Well, but it says statement shall be required.	1
3637798	that is not a tax...	1
8693083	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.	1
902845	It did, in part, lost income taxes and that kind of thing.	1
1529208	Does that enter into the calculus?	0
900315	They were?	0
8062667	Why didn't they say that? Why didn't they say that...	1
1280879	These were customers of a securities firm?	1
1313332	That's that...	1
973334	Do you take into account that the degree of harm, if you make a mistake?	1
9609378	You're arguing for a law of rules.	1
7390464	Supposing he raises the first ground on direct appeal and loses.	1
6012165	Yeah, but I suppose reasonable people could look at the pledge as not constituting a prayer.	1
586298	This is a suit, a diversity suit, between an Australian entity and a Virginia company about a rail accident on land, and why do you think Federal law applies?	0
1224949	I think the jury can maybe reason from that in deciding which witness' testimony they want to give the greatest credibility.	1
5800783	May I ask if...	1
5970083	Well, certainly you could, but I would think there would a difference in the kind of squeezing and manipulation that would occur to identify objects within a bag than would occur normally when you just move it to make more room for your own.	1
205470	You want us to overrule earlier cases about--	0
4838487	Does that help you?	1
1603333	Well, let me--	0
1369642	It doesn't app-	1
953262	It's a traffic infraction.	0
5409790	And you make that assurance to us today.	1
5664451	And only on the grounds that the respondent was not qualified for driving?	1
8005870	Has anything changed?	1
872839	Do you know what exemption is urged?	0
4232217	It is an administrative convenience.	1
347732	Your time's flying away here, and you haven't said a word about it.	1
4407570	Didn't she, a couple of times, hint that it would be... might be a good idea for defense counsel to seek a continuance?	1
7772675	service jobs, once a quarter, are all declared open?	1
6759	But in a library, when you're looking for a book, it might not be there, and you might have to go to the librarian and order it or borrow it from another institution.	0
527684	Mr. Smith, why shouldn't we be conscious of the holding of this Court in Denver Area v. the FCC where the Court concluded it might be premature to apply forum analysis due to changes taking place in the law, the technology, and the industrial structure related to telecommunications?	0
7020358	Mr. McCormick.	1
1168694	--and how do you equate it with other exercises of such a right?	1
4680349	Yeah, but it's absolutely clear, I thought, that the FDA, at the end of the day in some of these drug applications, ends up looking at not only safety, but how effective it is.	1
8010047	And some other people too?	1
13032	It should not... the rule's operation should not result in unfairness to defendants, and should not overload the courts with ineffectiveness claims that are asserted prematurely on direct appeal.	1
5592596	I thought you were asking to do more, not to leave... to say the Ninth Circuit test is no good, because it's wholly-related... not-unrelated won't do.	1
3311193	--You say the control is by governmental institution, and the principal of the school goes to this... sits on this board, or belongs to the... by reason of the fact he's a principal.	1
7599508	Do you know when that started?	1
1846870	And the Court denied it.	0
1848291	And was there a request made to do that or--	0
181313	Mr. Hufstedler, I guess the Ninth Circuit was persuaded by what it read into the words, in any election--	1
5620095	Do you take the position that you can file a suit against the Indian tribe without its consent?	1
7472141	So that what we do will make no difference in the... in the ultimate result in this case.	1
9010635	And I suppose it can't.	1
7775637	I would sug-	1
1835062	I suppose in the Anders opinion itself there's some indication that we wouldn't preclude other systems that were equally as effective, right?	0
5387326	If you follow one rule for benefit purposes, another rule for tax purposes, you get a bunch of anomalies they suggest, and your response to all of that is, as I understand it, that's been true for 40 or 50 years, and it really isn't all that serious.	1
3556235	until the end of twelve months.	1
4555424	The honorable court is now adjourned until Tuesday, the eighteenth of January at ten o'clock.	1
5960957	Mr. Phillips...	1
6636328	brief.	1
4727035	Through some months.	1
307385	You can answer that yes or no, I think.	1
4714820	by --	1
1035076	So for instance, a stop might reasonably take longer if there are more people in the car so that the officer has to check the the criminal histories of more people in the car.	0
52302	Do you think it was properly stated in that instruction?	0
4526708	Mr. McCormick.	1
3266806	Now here's what you do next, write some checks to the party.	1
5961687	at   community...	1
7249787	Let me ask you to comment on... on one thing--	1
3703844	I guess the C. A. Fed. applies a clear error standard.	1
1905969	but...	1
4275668	But isn't... isn't that our... our function in part?	1
1580516	Now, there's no record here of the colloquy at the plea?	0
342257	It's on pa-	0
8873167	--Well, but if you say the facts of Milwaukee are different than this, I... that doesn't answer why admiralty and common law should go on two different paths.	1
5866305	So the... the public is getting only the bad, and not the good.	1
5765297	Well, what about section 1742.1?	1
8583320	It treated CBM as a gas, did it not?	1
500157	That's an 11-minute traffic stop.	0
7644514	Is it our supervisory powers, whatever we think best, or--	1
969731	The reason we don't think that that's the right way is that we know after Caballes that a dog sniff is not an independent Fourth Amendment intrusion.	0
8380983	Mr. Burling, it is not your submission that those actions by the Government are only takings which are unreasonable? Surely the Government--	1
2607441	Let's--	1
394273	That's correct, Your Honor, and...	0
8370333	Now, if we adopt your position, I think I would agree with Justice Kennedy's implication.	1
6589455	I mean, take a look at Rule 1... it says when these rules provide for filing a document in the district court, the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court.	1
2430525	Was there another one that's in the joint appendix?	1
2311692	How should we interpret Taylor?	0
6951287	Well, in that...	1
2377506	The defense attorney went over the probation report with him the day before sentencing, and then when he was sentenced to 15 years to life he expressed no surprise at that.	0
7911269	that. But...	1
6650663	--Exactly, Your Honor.	1
3764059	Sure, but...	1
340156	Well, Congress, after the 1909-1910 acts, later passed legislation dealing with Federal land grants reserving gas in some circumstances to the Federal Government.	1
427765	Would you tell us how you differ with petitioner on what ought to happen here and why?	1
1345170	Is it sophistication of the parties or something?	1
7462575	And so certainly, so far as our remand order is concerned, the Supreme Court of Iowa is free to do whatever it wants so long as not... as it's not inconsistent with our opinion.	1
2104939	That is something that the -- that the courts are looking at as to whether that is something that you should be able to do.	0
7813175	Your...	1
2470143	The court of appeals didn't address it, and for purposes of deciding special needs we just assume no consent.	1
4228826	And it hasn't resulted in disaster, has it?	1
9469366	that's cutting it pretty fine.	1
1877560	Oh, fine, but you still have to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and grapple with what it means.	0
2383	Yes.	0
6412465	But I- But I don't have just legislative history as a matter of fact...	1
2206927	Yes, but the... the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?	0
1804827	You mean you...	1
8447068	That's what mechanic's liens are for.	1
363053	which they might prefer to do.	1
1326493	All right.	0
672747	Is that not before us?	0
3718016	You're asking us to adopt a rather confusing body of law.	1
7760859	You're saying in the later provision it only means one of those two.	1
8521830	And then you equate that with vice, and I think that slides away a little bit from the thrust of her concern.	1
2805716	Now here's what you do next, write some checks to the party.	1
6823138	Widespread.	1
9537461	dollars of taxes of the husband.	1
1993923	They think it's crazy to swim in Tennessee?	1
8440047	but   it's not the...	1
7306382	did IRCA add provisions and impose obligations on prospective employers to require them to review the documents and make sure that they appear to be regular on their face?	1
2345711	I will tell you that's what the courts say, that it has been accepted as part of the mission.	0
1713038	Okay.	0
1796344	And it is a little curious that the State isn't willing to talk to the prisoner's counsel about considering one of the other ways of doing it.	1
743599	Not 1338?	0
4052309	A Federal habeas petitioner?	1
2168065	The Roebuck facility has been closed now, as I understand it, and the incinerator removed.	1
6442212	Well, you don't need to argue that in order to prevail, do you?	1
9484026	And I don't know how far that would take us if we--	1
1047012	Right.	1
6031881	How does this violate the student's right to free exercise of religion?	1
48273	I mean, is that the way it works?	1
5371520	It means new cases, and that's it.	1
1436538	And if it is, then you're just wrong about it being only a defensive maneuver.	0
1817383	So if we don't accept your statement that it is the functional equivalent, then what standard do we employ for the tacit consent or the failure to affirmatively respond?	0
1049364	Mr. Comey, I think you rely, in part at least, on this Court's case in Whren--	0
1372042	But there was no attempt to correct what appeared to be a misstatement.	0
5041133	So, you know, it probably isn't burdensome to... in principle, to have some disaffiliation requirement, but does the State have to allow enough time so that the decision can be made with knowledge of whether the Libertarians are going to be on the ballot?	1
9442833	Defendant and his counsel say okay.	1
4833554	--because they don't really exist?	1
1338161	To... to get some kind of liability under the Lanham Act under a reverse passing off theory.	1
5775335	You'd think the latter section would be broader, not narrower.	1
572132	activity.	1
2305887	We're not suggesting that it is -- it is an ordinary incident of the traffic stop that you'd have to take time to stop--	0
4033178	That's kind of the question we have, how... what gloss to put on Taylor.	1
1542928	the national forest.	1
6888320	--I guess we upheld the right of a State to direct that primary... parties have to have a primary election rather than a caucus to select candidates.	1
640669	Is that perfectly okay?	0
8062650	u-	1
2714914	It would be the year received?	1
8981395	But I- But I don't have just legislative history as a matter of fact...	1
1843326	And they might change, as counsel for the Government told us, if there were a different mix of school at some future time, but right now, these leagues are overwhelmingly public.	1
2204973	That's the opposite theory one way, it's very simple case that way.	1
236699	It's such a small segment of the problem.	1
968360	Well, In- Indeed.	0
1928310	Yes, Your Honor, we...	1
3928546	Well, if they said they don't want to do it, then why are you arguing to the contrary?	1
291383	I thought they were all in the same boat.	0
5425450	And do the statistics also tell us how often under a Wende procedure the courts would actually find arguable issues on their review and send it back?	1
7865405	Surely the government can invite an outside group to come and give a speech or put on a presentation using government money, tuition money to ask them to do that.	1
1841815	but my client...	1
3361453	I can't reconcile it.	1
1511975	I thought your position on your brief was that there was no guarantee of the assignment, that one of the reasons why you said you had no remedy is that the labor code gives the prime contractor a right to seek the money that's being suspended, and the labor code itself doesn't give any right to the subcontractor, and therefore you said that there's no remedy guaranteed you under the law, I thought was... that was the position you took in your brief.	1
6146290	I was waiting for the second one but just before we get too far away from it, what was the second?	1
4778692	And so what we've done is introduced a little curlicue and told all the lawyers, by the way, it's when you file the petition in the district court, but for the CPC, and eventually I guess that word would get out.	1
6453079	May I answer as you go?	1
49688	But obviously you're holding up one that's a rectangle, so it makes sense to have the posts on either side, as opposed to the diamond shape, where it makes sense to have it in the middle.	1
7693887	We've been very insistent that you can't keep it away from adults, although a lot of people think it's addictive and harmful.	1
1593271	--You do if it's done before the -- the traffic stop is done.	0
2227992	The court asks again, do you understand that?	0
8121296	And unless you get to... to some fact pattern that... that gets you a... a higher level of scrutiny, it's not so much that we're engaging in rational basis scrutiny.	1
7520654	on the major life activity.	1
2448683	I can't reconcile it.	1
1482109	--supervision, and the consequences of a reversal here would be that he would go back on for a period of--	0
7348936	And so it's maybe closer to Strate.	1
8540660	But I mean, it can't be that... I mean, it can't be that narrow, so what is it about the content that could be better targeted to children than simply the content of cigarette advertising which gives, tries to give the message that it's a nice and sophisticated thing to smoke?	1
5374881	You're saying that Congress can't give this to the EPA unless it holds the rein pretty tight.	1
5394045	Okay, what is your authority for this broad initial proposition you're making?	1
9081488	give the information.	1
4421452	--Was there some reference to veil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth Circuit?	1
265442	But the law at the time this case arose was different, and there was no requirement... the labor department couldn't require the withholding, is that right?	0
8951094	I I don't s-	1
2216757	worker...	1
6857670	But the national party committees cannot transfer even down $10 to the state party for a voter mobilization plan.	1
2713855	--Well, what about Steel Company, though?	1
2124537	So I... I think there's a problem here.	0
1158836	Then there's no more justification.	0
3472130	but that is not the text of the statute.	1
741668	What has this Court historically done, do you think, on appellate review standard for mixed questions of fact and law?	0
288697	Pardon me?	0
2576576	Yes, here we think there has to be discovery.	1
2201444	Well--	1
7310727	I, I see that...	1
1606320	"""Oh, it should have been somebody else. """	0
1293230	--What's wrong about warning the public about who may be dangerous?	1
1672620	And it -- it is also fair to the plaintiff to be able to pursue this claim, these claims, some of which have nothing to do with the outcome.	0
1550167	Well, isn't it... but they say no, that it's imposed on the delivery to the distributor--	1
481925	Right.	0
8985006	Would such cases merit a CPC?	1
5323747	So at least under the system that we have had with political parties, the political parties are accountable and are transparent.	1
7510342	Is it your position that you consent that you waive immunity in Tribal Court?	1
336371	That the employer had no remedial scheme in place or what is it?	0
8880593	Did you?	1
4448437	Yes, but the rule that you propose would turn every for-cause ruling of the judge into an automatic reversal it seems to me.	1
5150480	On those 100 days, those releases put water in the canal where it is at that time because it is flood water, but on all the other days the water in that canal is not where it is, because of any flood control purpose, so we're talking about the water on all those other days.	1
3334057	thought...	1
3550659	In a document I have called the Post Flood Assessment it says that flood releases may also be made of the Friant Current Canal and Madera Canal if all parties agree, and that's rather baffling to me--	1
5431034	Do you agree with--	1
697062	Now, where are you... you're reading from a Coast Guard regulation?	0
1679294	But the Government--	1
644841	Yes, Your Honor.	0
2312113	Well, Your Honor, in the hypothetical posed...	0
6761739	twenty-one Q in particular.	1
368793	If Congress wanted to say you can't pass any new tougher ozone standard, why didn't it just say it, instead of having a provision in there that says you should revise it every 5 years?	1
8830651	What... what if the State simply decided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way that Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had criminal convictions of any sort without any more information in... in the last 5 years?	1
1899460	It's not a search.	0
984232	that even if...	1
594408	Mr. Mogin, I think it would be helpful if we focused somewhat on the statutory language in this case to figure out what it covers, and we have to read it, I suppose, in light of this Court's decision in McNally, which does appear to suggest that it... the statute covers only the scheme to defraud the victim of money or property, although the statute doesn't say so in so many words.	0
2802986	It's a strange...	1
1199125	Yes, Congress has done nothing about this, has it?	0
3380303	And if the allegation is that the officer did not follow the limitations in the authorized warrant, you think the tribal court can never have jurisdiction over those actions of the officer?	1
1283620	What has this Court historically done, do you think, on appellate review standard for mixed questions of fact and law?	0
4519149	I mean, you're saying--	1
2759709	parents.	1
658410	Well, it... it appeared, at least to me, to look to those areas where Congress required the Coast Guard to make regulations.	0
1157996	Why would it not be wiser for us to say, just to keep the systems running smoothly, look, we are not going to be bound by State court determinations of legislative intent or purpose?	1
5299114	So, this is just a red herring that you're entered into it seems to me.	1
9283550	And do the statistics also tell us how often under a Wende procedure the courts would actually find arguable issues on their review and send it back?	1
2640336	employee. It's  and they have...	1
9628860	Mr. Baker, are there not courts where something like this would come into the clerk's office, the signature is lacking, the clerk would say, well, it was filed within the ninety days, so we'll send it back with the letter, very much as this Court does.	1
9379525	Now, the states have not worked their way through that.	1
5868824	No, I take it... you're saying that, I take it, that the reference that the language on account of failure simply refers to the reason given by the State for withholding, as opposed to the fact of failure or nonfailure.	1
817742	Yes, and I guess that isn't before us--	1
2707268	Right.	1
5770948	Yes, Your Honor.	1
2521193	I  if...	1
5026730	Where do we find the section you're referring to?	1
7265962	That's such a tiny segment of the problem.	1
6402314	I... I look at that thing and it looks pretty amorphous to me.	1
8481699	There's...	1
1151724	But I -- I just don't think it's the right way to go. This is an area that could use some rigor.	0
2139611	Is that what you're saying?	1
9126379	Certainly in my home State of Arizona the casinos are right there in the largest urban center of the State, are they not?	1
1733281	I didn't think that was the evidence.	1
1003965	--on the basis that the respondent was employed as the investment advisor for this plan--	1
6129617	I guess those are not at issue here?	1
1008021	Telecommunications, we we don't have a position.	0
2690629	No.	1
5360641	No--	1
7792631	What I'm trying to figure out is why would a contractor sign a contract to go to a court that's never even heard of our... I mean, never even considered any arbitration matter.	1
7155834	this country.	1
6566093	Are those other than the ones in the footnote 25?	1
7380367	I I mean, I mean, you know it...	1
7753335	Mr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.	1
7707907	I don't see why the fact that it's boiler plate cuts one way or the other.	1
5473719	--and so forth.	1
2178491	I guess I don't really see what the administrative problem is in the back pay context.	1
4945780	restaurant charges...	1
7651251	And it turns out... do you concede that that was, in fact, not a lawful grounds for arrest?	1
1499334	Now, they didn't have that in mind.	1
223961	--do you think, in the board's rule?	0
3131100	Why?	1
4524415	Well, how... how is it retroactive if you say it applies to work performed after the effective date?	1
3984262	or how?	1
6496863	Maybe he deserves stigmatization if... with the high recidivist rate under the facts that Justice O'Connor gave you.	1
387941	What you can do -- no, Your Honor, I think -- Mr. Chief Justice, I think you do.	0
5969320	Mr. McAllister,	1
3488129	Well, don't... please continue to answer.	1
9100241	What we're asking you to speculate on is if the Government prevails and we say, fine, you can take the gas tank off, you don't have to have any degree of reasonable suspicion.	1
4598415	Every claim like that would end up in court under some kind of constitutional analysis.	1
5345532	Well, w- we would disa-	1
5842824	And yet, what you have just said again would indicate that's not a consideration in setting the standards.	1
3872927	restaurant can do is show evidence that would tend to determine, or help determine the amount of the tips, how many wha- what kind of a restaurant you have, how upscale it is, where it's located, the kind of meals you serve in fact, the IRS has a procedure where restaurants can show all that information, a sample menu to get below the eight percent.	1
4779568	ther-	1
3907516	So all this jurisdictional stuff is beside the point, because the rules are fairly clear that there is just... even if it isn't signed, it acts just like it was signed, but it is subject to being stricken.	1
5220914	But the normal rules of retroactivity do not apply uniformly to every matter governed by a statute.	1
2074958	Yes, but it's so odd that the agency that wants to take the position that the issues should be at least mentioned in writing the Appeals Council seeking review... I mean, it could do that without specifying what happens at the district court level... and say, as a claimant, you should set out the issues that you want the council to review, otherwise it won't review them.	1
798970	Isn't that what the form that EEOC...	1
7279399	As a Government funding matter.	1
948523	Does the State...	1
8976540	Why?	1
866403	better than this.	1
4600390	That would be a permissible regulation.	1
2575306	Well, there is a provision, though, in the labor code allowing a prompt hearing with the labor commission, or commissioner, to deal with this problem of the withholding.	1
6006764	All right.	1
7657000	under...	1
1706441	Okay. But we're...	0
3976066	If the...  if the words didn't cover it, there were catch-all provisions, investment contract is one.	1
186895	Well, what statistics are there that support that statement?	1
6156617	Assume a represented party who has a lawyer... a paper is filed which purports to be a notice of appeal on behalf of that person and not signed by anybody.	1
8536721	Miranda itself was from a State court.	1
1695760	[Laughter]	1
6637455	answer the question, though, and I have the same problem Justice Breyer does.	1
5481189	You're talking about the condition today, and what you're saying today is, whenever FERC sets a tariff that leaves the bottom line number to be filled in later, a State utility commission in a ratemaking proceeding may challenge that bottom line number in its own bailiwick.	1
6006189	People comply.	1
401871	So, typically...	1
7994758	a-	1
2245533	In light of that case.	0
1321421	You... you are asserting that Doe I and II are people who are no longer dangerous.	1
7936334	What is the Government's view?	1
9131008	the State does not have an interest...	1
9181116	Could you have sued the prime alleging that you had fully complied and had paid required wages in... under any provision of California law?	1
3400849	There's no escape from it.	1
8127405	Yes.	1
3117825	All you need is some flood control purpose in the project and that's enough, and you win.	1
4806608	That's correct, Your Honor.	1
1817699	Well, if it perceives it as a benefit, why does it have the restriction on coordinated expenditures?	1
8695640	court...	1
835048	--do you have to apply special--	0
1749521	That was a broad categorical rule.	0
1591295	Yes.	1
811410	And you think that there can never be a trade dress protection in some aspect of an expired patented item?	0
1254156	And the concern we have is with this expanded competitive need test that some of the lower courts have begun employing, and I am quite interested to know how you think the two doctrines can fit neatly together, because in an ideal world a trade dress could not cover something that was covered by a patent that's now expired.	1
951688	No.	1
128147	These petitioners are not part of the agreement?	1
6099814	[Laughter]	1
2163988	And this Court said that could comply with the Fourth Amendment?	0
1451742	Absolutely, Your Honor.	1
5050600	might have brought.	1
535479	I just didn't know how that worked.	0
6060460	It's a 20 percent rate, whether its roulette or card games or dice, it's all 20 percent.	1
349155	Is there not a routine urine specimen collected for someone in the hospital and tests employed?	0
8042978	What do you say...	1
3744395	But it would probably be even better if we set it at zero.	1
6234645	taxability at bottom a question of Federal law, do you suppose?	1
1028225	about this?	1
1694487	again I...	1
6149039	answer, and the board and the board cannot know in advance--	1
5139951	contracted workers...	1
6941263	Well, I really think that's irrelevant and that's... Justice Breyer suggested there should be a cap, that assumes the Government doesn't have to be reasonable on an ongoing basis, I think that's just wrong.	1
1486124	Well, I guess you take...	1
657535	Why wouldn't it be helpful to raise issues that the claimant thinks are important before the Appeals Council?	0
5226867	Now, where do you disagree?	1
4025412	And now when I look at the district judge's opinion, one of his points, one of them was not just the war of experts.	1
2972517	So in your view the principal would be quite unconstrained by the Constitution from voting to deny membership to a school because its athletes were black, or Catholic, or something like that?	1
8931046	Tell me.	1
4990897	--We could unify it the way that you don't want.	1
1065603	In 19--	0
6273576	I would have thought it was--	1
5261250	Would that comply with your test because you want to know what that says?	1
4808588	Well, why not?	1
2712490	We know somebody has filed a notice of appeal, but--	1
540406	That's... that's... the question Justice Ginsburg started with is every time... you just replied to Justice Scalia... and what I hear are words that seem to apply with equal force to a perfectly-tailored statute that would catch only the most dangerous sex offenders who everyone agrees are virtually uncontrollable and might repeat their offense many, many times.	1
297961	The State is saying, you give us the money that you owe to the sub.	1
5245754	That... that was the footnote in the Falter case?	1
4286738	interests. That's our case. That's this case.	1
4803392	Well well it's just not reasonable to...	1
1723321	Thank you, Mr. Garre.	1
4882556	What... what about the proposal some of the States have made whereby a provisional license could be given pending the eventual judicial determination?	1
331133	Is that what you're--	1
289669	Is there some way to avoid these problems now?	1
5132492	--Well, at that point at least there would be... I... I assume your... your point would be that there... there is at least a... a credible basis to say that if it covers only those who are affirmatively shown to be dangerous, the object is simply to apprise the public to who is dangerous, and that doesn't sound very punitive.	1
5088853	Excuse me,	1
7279831	Then they're saying, and if you say no billboard at all, that's the same thing.	1
3696823	[Laughter]	1
5563605	Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
8801422	So it's your burden.	1
9466030	--Well, but if they are bound by it, I don't see why, by a parity of reasoning, their interest may not be considered in valuing the violation.	1
7350498	First I thought that in winning this case, the tribes would lose the war because they'd have an awfully hard time getting people to contract with them.	1
1243836	And off--	0
4918962	Excuse me.	1
8347123	In fact, they rejected them.	1
8084758	But now we're, now we're... what I'm positing is a system in which the political party, which everybody esteems for different reasons, perhaps, but everybody supports, now, on your theory the political party can simply be given another useful task and the useful task, in effect, would be to eliminate the need of the candidate to be scrambling for the $100 contributions if it could accept, in effect, through the party, contributions in the amounts that Justice Breyer was talking about in his hypo a while ago.	1
1618666	Would you say coercion?	1
1082921	A- absolutely Your Honor, and...	0
5869569	--Your Honor, under... under strict scrutiny, which we believe is certainly applicable here, because this is not a contribution limit--	1
1135475	Well, what would they have to do to comply with the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, I mean, the judgment of the district court, which the Ninth Circuit affirmed?	1
3742987	Exactly.	1
2398018	You would also have to show that your underlying claim was substantial, and I don't think you had to do that before.	1
7160425	The Master also decided that there had been no undue delay on the part of Kansas in not instituting suit for another, what was it, 17 years, something like that?	1
2045206	all right.	0
1455810	So now the bulk of the earnings are from slot machines rather than the races.	0
9351187	Then there's a petition filed for habeas in the Federal court.	1
6760713	Maybe... well, this is just to clarify something that I had trouble understanding.	1
4293685	Mr.	1
5663576	Well, do you think it's fair to read the complaint that was filed as putting anyone on notice that it was a veil-piercing case?	1
2218592	That could be true, but to continue the question that the Chief Justice asked, do we at bottom have to apply a clearly erroneous test here to the determination of the facts?	1
2118250	Are... are there separate questions?	1
4155937	You think they didn't need an arrest warrant, they could just have--	1
4305523	artificial State law...	1
7649996	Well, in this case, has the court below directly ruled on whether there's a 107 cause of action here?	1
1566375	Would you tell us how you differ with petitioner on what ought to happen here and why?	1
431206	Well, I guess you would be content with just relying on whatever was disclosed at the plea colloquy in court.	0
7766190	If I may read Yes. Thank you, Justice Stevens.	1
8065911	No, no, no, but--	1
3712015	on...	1
7271057	we...	1
7817416	If it's a direct donation to a state candidate, if it is a Get Out the Vote phone bank that advocates that the voters go to the poll and vote for the governor, if it is a mailing, as under the California... as the California party affidavits of Ms. Bowler and Mr. Irwin indicate, that they send--	1
3308071	contingency...	1
1058498	--adjudicating the correctness of the application of rules for wholesale rates that are contained of thousands or millions of words filed before the Federal Power Commission.	1
4347495	Now, if the state decides not to give school vouchers for use in religious or parochial schools, do you take the position it must, that it has to do one or the other?	1
9109737	question, Your Honor.	1
3000394	penalty.	1
90076	say, does...	1
5512058	But if they are using Levin money, it's a crime.	1
1130185	Now, that was enacted, was it not, in 1887?	1
1010374	They told the Commission to set up a scheme that would be applied, because they wanted to make sentencing more uniformly applied in the Federal scheme of things.	1
1035174	Suppose a state has a school voucher program such as the Court indicated could be upheld in the Zelman case.	1
3057870	But he can certainly waive his Sixth Amendment right later.	1
2248169	--with a reference, and I suppose you would find that invalid as well.	1
1595058	But you don't take that position.	0
314474	I mean, he is not circumscribed in his activities, is he?	1
3691412	penalty phase.	1
66056	Here is the certification date.	1
3523207	The... am I wrong about that?	1
8530279	And it's dealing, Mr. Phillips, with the receipt of benefits by a... it was a beneficiary suing.	1
970458	--pursuing administrative claims adjudication?	1
2717694	In fact, that's the most common sense reading of it I would think.	1
5134499	I don't see why the jury gets into this at all.	1
1988268	That's why we think there needs some leeway for the officers to take some time to pursue -- to pursue the things that they observe.	0
1561531	Uh-huh.	0
2198184	Mi- the best I can tell you...	1
822265	--Well, you... you're saying that if there's a circuit different, there's a denial of equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment?	1
3066065	That is... I mean, I read your brief.	1
2937408	We were assuming that the parties spending money on gun control advertising, after consulting with the candidate about that, is not a coordinated expense, so the party would be able to do it.	1
8453389	Very well.	1
1074419	You know, if it required closing down the entire, the entire steel industry, for example.	1
3699595	--I was just going to ask you, do you agree with the proposition, or to what extent do you disagree with the proposition that the basic function of the party is to elect candidates and therefore a limitation on the ability of the party to give money to candidates pretty well disables the party from doing what it was created to do?	1
1693455	--Congress--	1
6004426	situation, Justice Chief Justice Rehnquist, in which if something is delayed and I think Justice Scalia asked that question.	1
4986024	This is not a... a Pullman abstention case here.	1
4483613	situation, it -- Right.	1
8275079	And yet the... the trial judge herself said to defense counsel, aren't you going to move for a continuance, when this bullet came... was unearthed after all that time.	1
7679745	It would?	1
1599451	Uh-huh.	1
4556139	The things above here are very bad.	1
7282190	Once...	1
6330385	but my client...	1
311155	May I--	0
2139145	Yes, all right.	0
8098344	So would you like this Court, then, to send it back and say, First Circuit, consider the theories that other courts of appeals have accepted?	1
6129472	What's your position on the jury instruction?	1
3265296	again what...	1
4491002	Well, why should that be so if the intent to appeal is clear from the face of what was filed?	1
1343367	Exactly.	1
1378195	So you don't agree with petitioner's counsel that it's a harder case, but wouldn't give it up?	1
6958439	money...	1
27979	But AT&T didn't bring an antitrust action.	0
1288422	Would you explain that?	0
3031704	What's the matter with stopping transient health of adverse health effects?	1
6874230	It is irrational to conclude that Congress would have defined security...	1
8523600	Sure.	1
496975	But once it's--	1
7326097	What do we do with that?	1
2559369	You're out of the college. I mean, that...	1
7421383	No, but you're talking about the money as though the money were particular dollar bills, and the subcontractor has a right to particular dollar bills that the prime gets from the State.	1
2989063	Well, I really think that's irrelevant and that's... Justice Breyer suggested there should be a cap, that assumes the Government doesn't have to be reasonable on an ongoing basis, I think that's just wrong.	1
5283560	[Laughter]	1
8220455	on the credit card...	1
4989114	--Thank you, Ms. French.	1
1775461	Uh-huh.	1
5974750	Why?	1
4081227	the evidence.	1
8951142	It's...	1
8746946	Congress did not make this distinction.	1
1786216	Yes, but you can't want to open it up to recovery of every bad investment that the plan makes.	0
6938055	doesn't answer the question, exactly.	1
5918377	I can understand that, but it's hard to know why the measure of money damages should be based strictly on, or in part on what the individual farmer would have lost if the State doesn't plan to turn around and give it to the farmer.	1
6756579	[Laughter]	1
3285084	Is that right?	1
3836568	or do they have to...	1
5004687	We're ar-	1
8873940	How's the lawyer supposed to know?	1
473772	--all... all along?	0
2025574	But certainly if you're not judgment-proof, you don't likely undertake an appeal because you can be assessed for costs if you lose it.	1
5705818	of incarceration.	1
6087413	Mr. Bell, wouldn't that be, wouldn't that be...	1
6043955	Well, I don't think we created a fourth question under Texas statutory law.	1
1561551	But does the award of damages from Colorado to Kansas in any way affect the Government's operation of those upstream reservoirs?	1
6886969	itself...	1
6985108	inaudible...	1
4510702	inmates...	1
9474788	But that's one of the things you'd look to?	1
9332689	Right?	1
1666269	No, no. Th- that's...	1
7827218	That's correct, Your Honor.	1
5150401	We could define that as a project that's substantially, but not entirely, used for flood control.	1
8653946	I don't know why you're here arguing there was no probable cause at the scene.	1
191945	all positions throughout the company, or in certain categories of...	0
5639903	you conceded you...	1
2083974	Except it does if you're... if you're right on your theory.	1
6956577	Much more...	1
5045982	I would answer that in two ways .	1
7616313	Justice Souter, the best that we can tell, and this is based on essentially anecdotal reports of U.S. Attorney's Offices, it's somewhere on the order of 20 to 40 percent, roughly, of cases in which new counsel represents the defendant on appeal, but that... I'd... I hesitate to rely too much on that figure, because it is based on the anecdotal reports--	1
1699008	[Laughter]	0
9038833	that?	1
4789380	purposes.	1
244765	He practices it without the same subsidy that is made available to every other citizen except someone who wants to study to be a minister.	1
9494481	violation.	1
9572570	Secondary and elementary --	1
5153589	But now the State enters into that exact same contract.	1
905316	[Laughter]	1
6742289	For purposes of deciding the issue on which we granted certiorari, special needs exception--	1
2075467	Well, let me ask you this with reference to this question of Justice Breyer. I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, that the district court found the hospital personnel conducted the urine drug screens for medical purposes, wholly independent of an intent to aid law enforcement efforts.	0
29785	The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.	0
9024999	You say she can still get it.	1
1672499	Well, it's what the--	1
2056671	[Laughter]	1
9144190	I mean, that... that seems to me a fall-back position that's provided for in the statute.	1
5161447	--Oh, I don't think that follows at all.	1
1616161	And how... how could they possibly do the best job they could on the opinion without letting the parties know what they were trying to do and to address the issue?	0
6988999	[Laughter]	1
256422	Well, even if there are arguable grounds for appeal...	0
6318938	I'm just late.	1
1743815	the act.	0
1037556	That's collateral and it's nothing but an -- an investigation.	0
6985411	Why?	1
919899	But in this case I had assumed there's been no determination whether there were arguable grounds.	0
3534119	That's the problem.	1
8788451	So your basic... one part of your basic rule is, if the plaintiff isn't barred by laches, then the defendant shouldn't be hit with prejudgment interest.	1
1183104	How long was it in effect?	0
9153392	Sullivan, in light of the Johnson case and the Neder case, I think the government has a very strong argument here.	1
716035	All right.	1
8284752	Well, but I mean, how is that different?	1
2000612	That just came out of no place.	0
1930647	Yes.	0
8617539	It wouldn't even mesh with Anders.	1
2011470	--Well, Your Honor, first of all, under strict scrutiny, the Government doesn't even argue this statute can pass strict scrutiny, so if the Court, as we submit that it should, since these, since these restrictions go to the very essence of what political parties do--	1
7561811	gross amount...	1
1098981	So...	1
4534873	But you apparently want us to draw a different one, and what is it?	1
2993925	You're turning your answers on the fact that you can't earmark the, the circuitous route, and so for my assumptions to be correct, I have to be assuming a fact that's debatable, and that is that the tally system works approximately similar to earmarking, but on my assumption that that's factually true, we get to my questions, but on the assumption it's not factually true, then your answers are... is that the point of disagreement?	1
7443719	my interpretation of that perinc- prin- --	1
4771	--He does have an incentive not to have a lawyer, because you're better off without a lawyer when you get to court.	1
5786302	Mr. Bell, a lawyer...	1
2052140	And was it complied with here fully, do you think--	0
538543	Something similar was said in US versus Bagley.	1
286427	Your point is... excuse me, your point I take it is that in your view the trial judge should have granted summary judgment to the officer, is that it?	0
1188334	because...	1
8500828	Well, let... would... would it ever... would the basis for an inadequate assistance of counsel claim ever be apparent on the trial court record without resort to extrinsic evidence?	1
3676425	how you got there. Uh-huh.	1
2016719	Not 1338?	0
145750	--So it didn't, in fact, come to grips with the evidence.	0
843947	go through the collection process.	1
1461353	A- absolutely Your Honor, and...	0
3527262	--Well, obviously, the... the defense counsel didn't know until the motion was made and ruled upon for a bifurcated hearing whether the judge would grant it, and there's no reason presumably that defense counsel should not have investigated the mitigating circumstances pending that ruling.	1
5403725	Well, how about the simple pro... does the statute say it has to be in writing?	1
1854963	There's no question about that.	0
7134695	Explain to me whether we've ever bifurcated forum immunity from immunity for suit... from suit?	1
3687277	last twenty years? I count two.	1
1624815	You want to see that, you want to see this spelled out.	0
3953442	Okay.	1
2054335	Well, the... the Ninth Circuit ruling seems very broad.	0
3864185	Whether it's reasonable has nothing at all to do with whether it's a taking, does it?	1
4058649	Yeah, they...	1
3836350	Well, there's a big difference between being, say, in Seattle, Washington, and Ellis Island, never being able to get off the island.	1
9204635	I thought the statute required that committee to advise the EPA of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of the national standards.	1
5364241	But it's not open to you to show that the legislature didn't really have that motive for the reason that if the courts permitted you to show it, there would be no end to that.	1
6166172	Well, Ms. Brinkmann, th-	1
9453294	Mi- the best I can tell you...	1
4064185	All right.	1
6357185	So what's the tax   so what's the employer...	1
668988	And yet, you're here arguing that we have to go back and change that.	0
8846392	So it's your position, in effect, that although the Ninth Circuit said it was an applied challenge, in fact the Ninth Circuit itself struck it facially.	1
7833495	Why is this any different?	1
3459518	I thought that's where we were.	1
3791737	And what's your position after 1985?	1
6014867	Is that clear?	1
5688212	It's just as applicable to instances where the Federal tariff is specific.	1
2338354	Is that a finding we have from the lower courts, that he is not dangerous to himself or others?	1
8611530	Your coal deposit is next door.	1
4385358	Is that right?	1
2312516	Yeah. And the Court in Nix made it pretty clear that we assumed there would be a fruits suppression.	0
1122385	Yes, Your Honor, and and I think with...	1
2701435	[Laughter]	1
594869	Well in in looking at a substantial limitation, do we focus on the things that the person cannot do or the things they still can do or both?	1
6499116	You have year-by-year employment.	1
577352	in this case.	1
1080619	Mr. Sarnowski, can I ask you about your interpretation of 2253?	1
5969813	It's not known in the other case that a judge determined this... this person had been cured to the extent that he could have the custody of a... a minor child.	1
1806901	All right. Then that...	0
5320730	This is punitive.	1
7893298	Boykin,	1
1785651	Your Honor, if I may say--	1
7055988	[Laughter]	1
330349	Well, this... this business of having a court recharacterize a motion as a 2255 motion was a doctrine that seems to have been developed before AEDPA was enacted, and some circuits since the enactment of AEDPA have decided that if they're going... if the district court is going to do that, that some notice should be given, certainly to a pro se petitioner, about the consequences of that recharacterization.	0
5424807	Or what about quarantine of someone who has a communicable disease?	1
3856886	I don't understand.	1
8447552	Well, I guess the one other concern would be the timing in Oklahoma is such that the... the Republican or Democrat who wants to disaffiliate in order to vote with the Libertarians has to do so at a time before the State has decided whether to allow the Libertarian Party on the ballot.	1
9234484	if he...	1
6926615	that they weren't...	1
748445	No.	0
789887	But from the officer's perspective, I think there's an interest in officers having some leeway to sequence the traffic stop.	0
7074854	functioning of...	1
2151402	But don't we have an issue here between billboards more than 500 and less than 1,000 feet from the schools?	1
5455905	suggests that an anonymity requirement makes it content-based.	1
1573541	Your Honor, I would say that that sentence --	1
9134815	I would say it has to be exclusive reference under the Siebold regime, Your Honor.	1
9095722	defenses?	1
1533870	No, that wasn't my question.	0
4966395	I'm just awed that you would think you would pick your best cases to give to supply the missing link in the experts' testimony, and yet the ones that you pick as your presumably best cases all make this district even odder shape than it's ever been.	1
223181	I frankly was more concerned with evidence that was newly discovered, and no basis for discovery before.	1
2117085	The fact that a special ed...	1
5177776	in the various...	1
2584651	Okay.	1
2023633	But your argument is a little extreme in the situation where, by State law, the defendant has to be there, and any time the defendant testifies, even if it's totally consistent with his prior but excluded confession, you say the prosecutor can nonetheless get up in summation and try to use his presence at the trial against him.	0
7726301	I don't e-	1
5641872	I mean, that's acceptable.	1
475123	And it sort of reads the phrase out of the statute in a sense.	1
9432098	can spend at the canteen --	1
6973198	Which one -- which one is that? Subsection.	1
2770113	--(i)--	1
7474516	Yes, but isn't one way to...	1
5002224	We do...	1
388314	Well, why isn't the Turner/Safley rule quite adequate here to deal with this?	1
2831176	What... what about the proposal some of the States have made whereby a provisional license could be given pending the eventual judicial determination?	1
1632246	You agree with the bottom line.	1
8423815	I guess you don't agree with Pilot Life.	1
2077389	But it's a little... it's a little like... if you're telling doctors what's medically necessary under the plan, it's in effect maybe defining the basic standards of medical care, in a way.	0
2974050	[Laughter]	1
245002	disorder.	1
8011267	like a basic difference.	1
6186572	[Laughter]	1
2092983	Maybe he deserves stigmatization if... with the high recidivist rate under the facts that Justice O'Connor gave you.	1
1825989	It's not that.	0
7186668	What do you say...	1
2140129	I think that's very, very, very significant.	0
8191933	that?	1
3701400	Thank you, Mr. Frederick.	1
8346892	Well, there was another district, Senate District 15, where the percentage dropped from 62 percent to 50.8 percent, and the Government didn't challenge that.	1
617570	Well, that isn't exactly how the question was phrased, unfortunately.	0
5991251	There simply is no opportunity here for judicial review of the determination of the discretion of the Attorney General in reviewing the conditions under which someone might be released with safety.	1
7864265	Then what's your fall-back position?	1
2231853	Why not go lower?	1
252009	So what am I supposed to do about that finding?	1
1810578	And it's... it's not imposed on a class of citizens by reason of their criminal past.	1
8765325	[Laughter]	1
4042658	Mr. Sutton, with respect to that trade-off, as you've described it, I take it now you're making a transition to First Amendment.	1
505395	So there could be a trade dress in an expired patented item.	0
3489877	Has there... has there ever been any proceeding here at all to determine what the issues are?	1
51633	It's just a matter of...  as a matter of convenience for everyone, I wonder why the prosecutor didn't point out that it was beyond the 180 days.	1
625829	I asked... I--	1
6771270	[Inaudible]	1
41793	And I'm interested... what we have in front of us now at this point as issues.	1
1470284	Well, we have said that the... in Minnesota v. the United States, I think we said that a proceeding against property in which the United States has an interest is a suit against the United States.	1
93331	Well, is that limited, though, just to things that affect the internal order of the ship?	0
9048625	Well, this Court has already held...	1
3336006	Why does it matter?	1
2976546	--And were objections made each time?	1
9556308	is a...	1
3262114	You have breached it in that your subcontractor has breached it.	1
298253	basically correct?	1
9125571	Mr. Everett, can I ask kind of a basic question, prompted by Justice Scalia's question.	1
2349364	So the release was in response to that order of the Federal court?	1
6887703	In this case--	1
76316	Is that correct?	1
4472231	I would like to take just a minute on the question of the... whether a typed name can constitute a signature.	1
5157249	But this isn't a question of State law.	1
7132601	I've heard this...	1
4404245	w- Well, no -- my predisposes...	1
1916002	Well, you don't need to argue that in order to prevail, do you?	1
6390964	Did they do it for no reason at all?	1
1637427	Well, is that limited, though, just to things that affect the internal order of the ship?	0
1547206	--But your--	1
969493	Well, I -- I understand.	0
919100	Well--	0
2569113	Because of Article II, which, after all, does give the legislature plenary power and must have wanted... it must have wanted to have the laws in place so that it wasn't... so that Florida wouldn't risk losing its electoral votes.	1
8737989	my neighbor had.	1
3799758	N- not necessarily.	1
7310698	to the employer.	1
9220465	But if the Coast Guard were silent on some of these points, you still think there is Federal--	1
3746421	For instance, if I read this clause about, you know, you can bring suit in any court having jurisdiction thereof, if the tribe were taking the more limited position, which I gather the United States is, that this was at least an agreement to suit in the Tribal Court.	1
4106500	That certainly isn't this case.	1
844424	Well, I thought that's--	1
1761951	narrow range...	1
4183562	circumstance where a cus-	1
5912565	Does the agreement require some kind of consent by the parties to release any flood water in the Madera Canal?	1
483467	--as well as--	1
5438176	--Kennedy gave you, why isn't that covered by the QDRO section--	1
384848	--Percutaneous.	1
1974898	So, we're really talking about licensing schemes.	0
5099626	Is there such a price today that could be paid if a farmer were to go out and buy water from another farmer who had some?	1
6710612	Just on this whole issue, you're arguing that this might be in Tribal Court.	1
5729087	Codify what?	1
7371028	So there has been no discovery at all from the policy group, and you claim, of course, that they are totally exempt under the plain language of the statute.	1
6025532	Okay, I'll give you that for the sake of argument.	1
6099889	which this court...	1
8223795	That's our problem, and I... so will you address that when you get to point 2?	1
7971803	You're saying, well, it's not intuitively sound because we have no examples of what would go on if I won the case.	1
9462062	There are millions to be made from pay...  owning payphones, watch the profits add up.	1
1248549	Well, don't... please continue to answer.	1
8155249	But the one difference is, as Justice Scalia points out, it isn't the prime that made the decision to do this.	1
1030522	Thank you.	0
1643971	Yes, Your Honor.	0
8509175	about this?	1
2460714	Are there also State tort remedies?	1
4429321	can happen. And...	1
9242507	Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.	1
3187709	--Your Honor--	1
1592179	From the point of view of the taxpayer, it will make a difference if they use tips to satisfy their minimum wage requirement,	0
72361	Yes.	0

5098883	[Laughter]	1

7580721	when the employer is paying it out of one...	1
803915	Where is it written that you can only warn the public about those whom you have... are sure are dangerous?	1
6974827	What do we do with the Oneida II case decided in 1985?	1
5191803	And I suspect if we try to narrow it a lot, we're going to have a lot of litigation about this point.	1
152195	0 [offmike.]	1
2355292	You don't concede, do you, that giving a negative response to any... to all of the three questions on the basis of the mental incapacity of the defendant would have been irrational?	1
4612524	[Laughter]	1
1638971	Your point is... excuse me, your point I take it is that in your view the trial judge should have granted summary judgment to the officer, is that it?	0
4398025	--type of confession or something.	1
1478450	The federal law prohibits an Indian tribe from accepting... a Tribal Court from accepting jurisdiction in a case like this?	1
44274	I think it's...	1
8258220	Well but no that but that wasn't...	1
8861351	considered.	1
805363	It's the joint appendix.	0
3871069	[Laughter]	1
8237378	I mean, how... how many times within that 20 to 40 percent category do we get into an argument later on as to whether 2255 can be availed of because, in fact, a... a record was sufficiently developed to... to raise the... the claim on direct?	1
8829850	Thank you, Mr. Frederick.	1
2715336	i-	1
2787862	Right.	1
6718364	[Laughter]	1
5479414	You don't think that's irrational?	1
1666992	To say no harm's done if, you know, we interpret the ambiguous thing the wrong way, Congress will fix it, it's a different Congress.	1
1216479	Mr. Chief Justice...	0
8944437	The investor doesn't care whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return.	1
8688615	If the discrete situation applies in the accident, why shouldn't the discrete situation, in effect, rule apply here if they can show by the records kept by the dam that except in, let's say, five instances in which the canal was used for overflow for flood control purposes, all the other water that was diverted into that canal was for nonflood-control purposes and therefore you would get your immunity on some apportionment theory?	1
697538	It's a perfectly plausible alternative forum.	1
8849446	If that's your point, then how do you respond to their argument which is that that's just too tough to do?	1
5921526	That's necessary.	1
6243175	--in the act also suspended everything for an indefinite period of time.	1
2714911	I understand that, but my understanding of the Government tells me that in that case it is attributable to the month in which it was paid, and I'm trying to find out what--	1
5118778	But didn't that deal with the trading post... the little markets that sell things?	1
3260514	If that's--	1
3418778	That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.	1
7610885	--But that's all that's before us is the religious worship.	1
3295461	[Laughter]	1
1395735	And in Arkansas Electric, I think we held that a Federal decision to forego regulation in a given area may imply an authoritative Federal determination that the area is best left unregulated and would have as much preemptive force as a decision to regulate.	0
1015482	You're talking about a dog sniffing on the exterior of the vehicle that was legitimately stopped for a traffic violation.	0
5639355	They are two separate issues.	1
5939622	[Laughter]	1
6842278	It was illusory?	1
7391328	Well, you're arguing...	1
2776589	that's right.	1
1175014	Well, that surprises me to hear.	1
8994228	at that point.	1
363507	Let me ask, in the context of this very case, the officer sought summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue.	0
4275078	adult videotapes? And you think he...	1
1603469	Well, this... this business of having a court recharacterize a motion as a 2255 motion was a doctrine that seems to have been developed before AEDPA was enacted, and some circuits since the enactment of AEDPA have decided that if they're going... if the district court is going to do that, that some notice should be given, certainly to a pro se petitioner, about the consequences of that recharacterization.	0
5232221	Is that your basic position?	1
421095	Well, let me ask you this.	1
7695494	Suppose...	1
2390008	Can you point to the record anyplace where you took the position below that Federal law could not and did not apply?	1
2209441	Is there a constitutional violation?	0
9036406	It seems to me that one things that cuts across all the instructions are the special issues that were given to the jury at the very end and with respect to each of the three special issues, the jury was said in order to say no to that, we the jury because at least ten jurors have a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired into in this special issue find and determine that the answer... issue is no.	1
5254829	It would be impossible to administer this statute.	1
3575844	Even though some other employee on the basis of greater seniority than the respondents under the plan could take that slot?	1
1882718	search budget...	1
9548676	Well, what--	1
3683858	[Laughter]	1
4940024	Well...	1
2113028	Could they not I  I'm imagining I just heard about...	0
950143	That surprises me, because generally transactions on trust land might be dealt with differently in terms of state and county taxes.	1
2389000	Mr. Bromberg, do you think that the word may in section 9, 10, and 11 must be interpreted the same way?	0
5913921	correct, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
9430289	What if, what if the party consults the candidate and says, you know, we're thinking of running a series of issue ads, and we're going to say you're a big supporter of gun control?	1
5612505	So you think the traveling public has no reasonable expectation that their bags will be left untouched, except for being moved?	1
2785914	May... may I address a... a slightly different argument that you were making, I think you were making a minute ago?	1
5573727	I take it your claim is based on leaching out, or some sort of damage to the soil over a period of years.	1
4367688	--I don't know quite how to deal with it.	1
82858	Is there any rule of lenity concerns or anything of the sort because we are dealing with statutes imposing criminal penalty?	1
943197	indiscretion...	1
7362732	And one of your complaints is this system provides no way out.	1
7227355	[Laughter]	1
3145468	It's on--	1
400506	Ms. Jorstad, wouldn't it be helpful to the court to have an explanation of arguable issues and why they were rejected?	1
8674322	the sentencing isn't a mass. Okay, thank you.	1
7366127	as the cause.	1
2484671	--If we ever look to the real reasons for things, it would be a disaster, wouldn't it?	1
3525924	one.	1
5105722	down his tips in a little book, and there are...	1
1928764	seems to have been addressed to a specific problem, making it perhaps not content-neutral.	0
975707	And they had served their sentences, presumably.	1
8200996	Thank you.	1
7430956	They're both out, aren't they, and under certain terms and conditions?	1
5068393	You're saying his evidence does not justify doing what he claims, in addition to the settlement.	1
3518561	That's not your job.	1
8004464	And are the...  is it blue boundary that...  in that map that shows the land in question?	1
1824550	I thought that there was a finding in... that the principals who attend these meetings are customarily reimbursed.	1
1466687	I mean, true in terms of money, it's the fees.	1
5213407	[Laughter]	1
543533	--Federal Government seems to be trying to provide those incentives.	0
135844	Do you take into account that the degree of harm, if you make a mistake?	1
6077710	Once...	1
8124377	The defendant.	1
471323	Well, Your Honor, I think the understanding was that he would receive a 15-year term and that the possibility of probation was highly unlikely.	0
519714	Thank you, Mr. Me- Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.	1
6728702	So that's nice and administratively convenient.	1
1335117	These are just like... there are... all rules and regulations they pronounce after... if you prevail will be State rules.	1
906913	Which would make it important to have a protest.	0
1004506	It's hard to say what claim the Petitioner is making.	0
4686154	I somehow had the impression that we were dealing here with a crossing that had crossbucks installed under the minimum program for a State.	1
6027750	take advantage of it?	1
831774	Right?	1
1013485	to stop.	1
4320842	Good.	1
9592877	Let me ask you to comment on... on one thing--	1
202404	For income tax purposes, nowadays it's '94 income, is that right?	1
5636896	But not in 1512.	1
3904326	[Laughter]	1
4961630	of our brief,	1
8073543	[Inaudible]	1
778098	Officer safety is certainly a reason to ask for backup.	0
7857221	So is it a step to say they can implicitly agree the same thing?	1
1754780	The question is whether this allegation has to be made within the 30 days or whether it can be offered subsequently as an amendment.	0
4306174	I take it there are many, so I just want to get your--	1
2833468	Mr. Coleman, we'll hear from you.	1
2199828	So the only answers that you could come up with would run right into this bizarre shape, you would make it more bizarre shape.	1
6378421	Wouldn't this have been the most controversial provision in the whole reform package, if that were so?	1
2044754	One way would have been to add a fourth question and say	1
7514176	No.	1
7010068	And he did.	1
9599287	Now, you say that would allow them to get into state court because the arbitration agreement incorporates the State Arbitration Act, which refers to a state court of general jurisdiction, right?	1
2195769	They're hard for us, too.	0
8991940	Well you're...	1
8854477	So that's still open.	1
27371	that...	1
1802919	Isolated, intrastate pond?	0
5546658	[Laughter]	1
1411749	Is that okay?	0
4094349	And have we applied a more circumscribed review over the means of effectuating those policies?	1
5471828	[Laughter]	1
6678796	That money is not subject to the allocation regulations.	1
5893743	There's latent flood danger, and the entire project is designed to accommodate that.	1
944422	All right.	0
4582796	I...  I respectfully submit that it is, that the students in the Rosenberger that were publishing those articles were publishing articles that advocated belief in God.	1
7219322	Well, in our past Miranda cases I think the Government has taken the position that Miranda warnings are not constitutionally required.	1
3556428	Well, I know that, but why shouldn't he have?	1
4874468	But certainly that's what you're arguing.	1
1088846	--That's right.	0
8225089	--I think the kick of the gas tank or the tapping showed it was full, not hollow.	1
1516259	I'm assuming they exist.	1
7966456	there is.	1
1855319	Isn't there... don't you think your candidates generally feel sympathetic to people who give a lot of money to the State committee, even under the current regime?	1
1304987	And that allows you to file a suit.	1
83361	It sure is.	0
8386946	That's necessary.	1
6234502	[Laughter]	1
3173121	[Laughter]	1
6447680	So is there no mechanism whereby suit could be brought demanding that a certain area be closed because of the impairment?	1
1340976	Those are things, Your Honor, that have been accepted as part of--	0
6078654	is privileged.	1
4621847	Now at this level you max out again.	1
2166459	And is it a 1983 action, or is it not?	1
3217253	--is his point.	1
4813522	There are millions to be made from pay...  owning payphones, watch the profits add up.	1
72445	Yes.	1
101444	That just came out of no place.	0
6252121	Suppose they had the same statute, but instead of it... applying it to people who were convicted, they applied it to people who had been arrested, or alternatively, they applied it to people whom a policeman said he had gotten suspicious information about that he believed was accurate, no arrest... now, suppose it's exactly the same, but they just do... they apply it not in that way.	1
1991137	You don't want us to redetermine the facts, do you?	0
5367344	A significant number of States require the raising of ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal, and judge the raising of an ineffectiveness claim on collateral review by a cause in prejudice standard.	1
2829546	if there are no...	1
2468365	characterized as an adult use Adult use or business, that's correct.	1
2121403	And I'm interested... what we have in front of us now at this point as issues.	1
3160001	That seemed to be an important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.	1
1031399	Now, is the Government espousing that or what?	1
1423660	And is that okay?	1
1033385	case by...	1
2002415	I think you are reading something in that isn't there.	0
3214123	I mean, California wouldn't have to do it this way.	1
9221182	I mean, this is based on a compact, isn't it, this lawsuit?	1
2957897	All right.	1
8439474	[Laughter]	1
1149382	In every State of the Union you can drain?	1
9133062	will run...	1
7552878	For what reason?	1
8955387	And they had served their sentences, presumably.	1
8422504	May... may I address a... a slightly different argument that you were making, I think you were making a minute ago?	1
8629375	Hm?	1
4700239	Well, if you can find for us a civil purpose that clearly cannot be fulfilled, is that one index at least, or one indicator of an intent to punish?	1
5721630	reasonable beyond a reasonable doubt, yes.	1
5119613	So I think that's a different case.	1
4894992	So you mean the 1990 standard has to last forever?	1
8276696	[Laughter]	1
9617074	in the statutory...	1
7087678	Right?	1
2248945	Well, let... let me ask you about Professor Davenport's theory.	1
4035044	So what is the source of the Congress' authority over navigable waters?	1
8224939	Now assume, for the sake of argument, that we don't accept the analysis for purposes of Federal equal protection.	1
6620583	Wh- where is twenty-one thirty-one...	1
6674438	It goes back.	1
4467971	Right?	1
4664853	But this isn't, strictly speaking, ballot access.	1
5017298	You're arguing for a law of rules.	1
5172089	--clearly has decided the claim on a Federal basis.	1
8321668	It's a hypothetical case.	1
7102239	In the 15.6 million dollars of non-Federal money that the Republican National Committee spent in the 2001 off-year election, when there were no Federal candidates on the ballot--	1
1933758	Now, one other housekeeping sort of question.	0
2329522	easy concept.	1
5315714	Yes.	1
7713882	Indeed the Court noted in Buckley that no societal interests would be achieved if a loophole closing measure allowed unscrupulous persons and organizations to spend unlimited amounts to influence a Federal candidate.	1
2628569	That's right.	1
6675895	[Laughter]	1
6380206	--Yes.	1
4788870	And you have no problem with, in God we trust, on the coins and that sort of thing?	1
5650520	When does the conspiracy terminate, in your view?	1
863864	There are two cases here: one in class actions I take it, one involving female prisoners and one male prisoners?	0
4589180	I gather that they're saying, anyway, that the service of process issue is not properly before us.	1
6787240	It's highway departments that are buying it.	1
3949418	the abeyance...	1
5061690	But I would say the...	1
3732908	our...	1
1223727	I guess what bothers me about this is that clause (b) of 18 U.S. Code, section 16 is... it says the crime of violence means any other offense that's a felony and, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.	0
1983942	All right.	0
2394863	The court of appeals didn't address it, and for purposes of deciding special needs we just assume no consent.	1
2623793	But why?	1
9010756	say, does...	1
7246436	and in fact, he...	1
5973515	--Thank you.	1
1277628	Based on the judge's discretion, that's perfectly okay.	0
4149885	Now, if the state decides not to give school vouchers for use in religious or parochial schools, do you take the position it must, that it has to do one or the other?	1
9531999	So that much is clear.	1
7383436	You're both in agreement that would do?	1
5292640	I thought IRCA itself enacted a provision making it illegal for aliens to provide false documentation to get employment.	1
6127771	[Laughter]	1
1396990	That, in fact, involved pretrial deprivations -- deprivations of right up to the time of trial.	0
8973694	And are the...  is it blue boundary that...  in that map that shows the land in question?	1
951015	I mean, that's what I--	1
8523601	A potential...	1
1883444	Not talking about general limits on contributions?	1
9349168	[Laughter]	1
2728492	The regulation specifically says the individual... the threat to the individual can be considered.	1
2677249	It's not just like the year-end bonus, or something like that.	1
8938163	[Laughter]	1
5278148	do something.	1
583553	I... I thought PLRA became effective April 26th, 1996.	0
1340488	consistent with the whole...	1
1109767	The taxpayers of the State of Colorado will end up footing the bill, and it just seems odd to me that we would all of a sudden craft some rule allowing prejudgment interest against a sovereign State.	1
1814088	And you're just saying that some of the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government to pay for some kind of core Federal function, not that the contracts violated that provision.	1
728818	What it could...	1
946060	It would make no sense, would create a gigantic loophole where individuals, by changing the terms of...  from pie in the sky to 14 percent, and they would do that immediately, and Congress would have to deal with it in a way the Congress has already dealt with, and there is no reason to change what they...  what the law has been, and the Eleventh Circuit decision should be reversed.	1
6057886	Now, you say that's just shorthand for those portions of Greensboro that were reliably Democratic.	1
774356	I think what we said is that the mental incapacity has to be one of the factors the jury is allowed to take into account and I think it's a perfectly reasonable way for the judge to say find no to one of the Texas special issues in the statute, if that's... if that's what you... what you think is the case.	1
6253563	The effect of the California provision would be to not allocate it at all.	1
4400530	Well, he didn't say why he wanted to do the fill, did he?	1
8600088	Honor. That is my position.	1
4405023	All right.	1
4644657	space on...	1
3996267	Is he an assignee automatically, because he's the subcontractor?	1
1666758	They use it in all their contracts.	1
2320259	Was that an alternative that was reasonable?	0
5543258	I mean, let's say 1,000 cars cross the border point in an hour.	1
4627629	The appellants say that the court's just wrong or the expert's just wrong to say there were more heavily Democratic precincts with white populations, with heavier white populations that were excluded.	1
645532	And if so, what is it?	0
9577677	Why didn't they say that? Why didn't they say that...	1
3084497	one on one...	1
4301925	What is the... why does the restriction on coordination give you a problem?	1
4439331	Your Honor, if the only word in 323(a) were receive, you would be right.	1
1397735	We would normally think that, wouldn't we?	0
1706578	You'll lose your job.	1
5003163	And all of these things would be relevant in the voluntariness inquiry, would they not?	1
3156514	Then wouldn't we be able to say that constitutes State action at that point and you would subject it, conceivably, to an equal protection analysis if the issue is raised, and apply rational basis or whatever it is?	1
8390086	This is highly addictive, and especially dangerous to children, who can get hooked at age 13, and can't get off it for the rest of their lives, so it isn't like even sticks and stones can break my bones, bad words.	1
8314585	Not only that, you have...	1
5630793	Assume that one of them is plain on the face of the record, he didn't object to... you have a whole bunch of, line of interrogation was plainly improper, and the second ground is not plain on the record.	1
4203201	Well, you could sue somewhere under California law?	1
4040450	The honorable court is now adjourned until Wednesday, the twelvth of November at 10 o'clock.	1
7634278	You don't weigh the one against the other.	1
4778458	The New York law?	1
1008000	I'm saying in your opinion, what does it mean?	1
3935141	I mean, why is this worse than those?	1
7887832	But...	1
946774	Mr. Sutton, may I tell you why I at least am concerned about your saying this is like any other commodity, but it really isn't.	1
6138287	up- u- Absolutely, and a- absolutely...	1
2325381	But, it does--	1
3597164	repeatedly in --	1
2754953	With regard to section 323(a) and setting up separate accounts, you've described the situation before the statute was formed.	1
8936455	Could you answer my question yes or no?	1
8688379	been true.	1
922759	I mean, there is no Iowa law pertaining to slot machines in particular.	1
8240662	[Laughter]	1
8974790	And say it is unexhausted and... and the... a Federal statute of limitations hasn't run.	1
3586297	Now, you say that would allow them to get into state court because the arbitration agreement incorporates the State Arbitration Act, which refers to a state court of general jurisdiction, right?	1
2828155	is implied here as a...	1
8143669	Would you say, nonetheless, it's still punitive?	1
7229996	Is that your position?	1
1702814	Is that enough?	1
1838948	Well, does... does any entity in a society, a... a nursery school have an interest in... in knowing the background of their employees?	1
8329228	They're not drilling into your coal deposit.	1
9301135	Some of them are like Alaska.	1
3993911	What... what if the State simply decided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way that Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had criminal convictions of any sort without any more information in... in the last 5 years?	1
3755481	On the facts of this case, could the plaintiffs have gone to a court of competent jurisdiction and established an equal protection violation?	1
622536	Well,	0
3568698	How does the appellate court know whether deference, as required by the rules, was given unless the appellate court can see it?	1
4213413	A $100 donation solicited by the chairman of the RNC to a California gubernatorial candidate is not prohibiting that, making that a felony, is not closely drawn.	1
5114756	Yes.	1
223727	But the legislature has already ignored both of those rules to such a degree that further distortion appears immaterial.	1
7786387	Now, where do you disagree?	1
2095858	Thank you.	0
1103009	And I just wonder whether that's valid.	0
3975122	That's... that's the trouble.	1
23667	--No, they thought... Nierotko was very simple, really.	1
7020218	and I doubt that -- that it applies to --	1
2153752	You have no exceptions, in your view.	0
4144311	My neighbors know that I've committed a crime, but they don't... the same reaction... the notion that I am being labeled not a convicted offender... which I am... but a sex offender, a current status... a current status with no opportunity to get out.	1
9493005	the same. That C and D provision-	1
9148262	The second problem I have, and I would like you to address that if you can is, I don't see how it helps your delegation problem to simply add the economy to the ineffable pot of things that the administrator is supposed to consider.	1
3462484	Is that enough?	1
2370846	Three.	1
4914953	anything less...	1
4737653	No, Justice...	1
423596	Would you say coercion?	1
2386490	All right.	0
6669090	Was there any evidence that the jury cards in this... in the actual trial were marked or noted on the basis of race?	1
8519534	And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states.	1
9471287	--Why, if I pay in January for something I should have paid in December because I'm just late, why isn't that back pay?	1
7004438	the need...	1
8783580	I'm not making the argument.	1
3238322	Just on this whole issue, you're arguing that this might be in Tribal Court.	1
3727690	It's always hard, though.	1
2379539	In fact, the vast majority fail.	0
8806216	Would such cases merit a CPC?	1
3010027	because the British...	1
7562683	And all of these things would be relevant in the voluntariness inquiry, would they not?	1
565830	Justice Scalia, Did you have a question?	1
1718117	they can.	1
1079873	Thank you.	0
455556	-- in limited circumstances, for example, where, although there is sufficient evidence to satisfy probable cause, the 1983 plaintiff alleges that there is unrelated independent evidence that is fabricated.	0
2781805	The best way to tell what the fair deal was, it seems to me, is to read the text of the statute, and this is phrased as a very broad ban against the States going beyond the electronic media ban that was contained in the statute.	1
8363880	You would always look at the underlying claim, so that even if the underlying claim... if the underlying claim was statutory, or based upon a treaty, and then in the disposition of that claim the procedural right that was denied was so fundamental that it was a violation of the Constitution to deny that procedural right, and then the violation of that procedural right is sought to be appealed on habeas, you would dismiss it because the underlying claim, after all, is not a constitutional claim.	1
5415601	So of course you allocate it back.	1
152424	What if we were to think that at least as applied to the district's own purchases of vehicles, that it could limit itself to what kinds of vehicles it wanted to purchase and therefore is valid at least in part?	0
326454	What process do you say is due before someone can be made a party to amend, to bring someone in?	1
1930742	all right.	0
6441505	And we have a representative of that commissioner here before us today saying that under the statutory and regulatory scheme, that payments such as these for foster care are in the best interests of the child.	1
1429927	But you take the position in the brief that perhaps it isn't.	1
1412270	This section imposes a tax on employers.	0
9471601	is that your...	1
7891728	No, but seriously, I mean, what... how could that standard ever be satisfied in the case Justice Breyer gave you, except on... you know, some silly assumption like that?	1
4420281	--before they're disrupted by a Federal judgment.	1
8044421	You're saying this organization itself is the State.	1
705447	So if we don't accept your statement that it is the functional equivalent, then what standard do we employ for the tacit consent or the failure to affirmatively respond?	0
516060	If so, how?	0
726468	Well, what if we think that's not correct, that it is not the equivalent of a guilty plea?	0
9492692	How could it have been written...	1
1081953	the sole...	1
1352052	All right, so they're all terms of the contract, so the answer is, you have a claim, you think... or you get the money, they think you don't.	1
5098047	And that we contend goes too far.	1
8232476	But is there any other effect by virtue of the finding of the unfair labor practice?	1
193110	And you're going to tell me no, it's not different.	1
7899909	[Laughter]	1
1657386	It it has...	0
4727889	Well, but I take it under the registration form we're talking about, that the date of the conviction is there, and the... the citizen can make up his or her own mind as to whether the conviction was so long ago that they're no longer worried about it.	1
1630153	What does it turn on then?	0
593056	Is this a question of Federal law?	0
953056	given in this case that the attorney did provide that there was ineffective assistance at sentencing? Do we take that as a a gi-	1
316592	Why does he have to show why he wanted to do the fill? I mean the only change was the fill, he said I've got a swampland in front of me, I'd rather be able to walk on it.	1
1719544	--Well, I think there are two ways to understand the language in the two cases you're referring to in Caballas.	0
1877384	For income tax purposes, nowadays it's '94 income, is that right?	1
2292533	No, but it seemed to decide the case based on its view of the statute as just applying to generic drugs or something--	0
6506746	What? That's right. Exactly. That's right.	1
6490433	What details?	1
7989665	But if you're... if you're right about how Iowa goes about doing things, then you go back and tell the Iowa court, the Supreme Court has this any conceivable purpose test.	1
8860903	Well, I really think that's irrelevant and that's... Justice Breyer suggested there should be a cap, that assumes the Government doesn't have to be reasonable on an ongoing basis, I think that's just wrong.	1
3195471	ahead.	1
7247860	Why shouldn't the federal court have decided these issues of immunity of the officers when it had the case before it?	1
8178777	No, we're assuming... I think we were assuming a narrow definition of coordinated expenses.	1
1454195	The argument's that being made by the respondent here is an argument that the Blue Sky...  a distinction that the Blue Sky Laws don't make.	1
3820909	No, no.	1
2545263	That's the question here.	1
7038219	What is it about an admiralty case that makes prejudgment interest proper, and not in a common law case.	1
7529639	Well, is there a...  but you take the position that it would be proper in every case.	1
2109547	The traffic stop done--	0
4862601	--but... but I don't think you carry the day on that point.	1
1689534	that proceeding.	1
3026955	--You sued the... and why did you not sue the--	1
7134750	I mean, of course, they had a right to copy it.	1
1681190	I suppose that's invalid, is that right?	0
9384319	I gather is what you're --	1
1081630	That, in fact, involved pretrial deprivations -- deprivations of right up to the time of trial.	0
1821716	that. Or --	1
1923018	You don't agree?	0
1347256	[Laughter]	1
654650	You mean the first degree burglary conviction--	0
2180640	--statute says.	1
643695	--need for a--	1
4635949	But it seems to me that what you're doing is combining the analysis of whether there is a deprivation of a property interest with the analysis of whether there is an adequate State process for asserting it, and you have said, I guess your third point is, there is an adequate State process and therefore there has been no denial of due process in this situation.	1
6770187	It alters the amount of evidence necessary for conviction.	1
39207	Well, I mean, if he has arguable grounds for an appeal, then there would be a duty to advise of appeal rights, but...	0
1169765	businesses.	1
5291574	Suppose... I'm now giving you this.	1
2230587	Now, this ad could have been run by your clients by a segregated fund.	0
991360	Well, it's not all that clear, and I think there are many cases where it wouldn't be clear.	0
3003449	But in your view in looking at the standards governing EPA's setting of these national ambient air quality standards, you think that the EPA may not consider any of these economic or cost factors--	1
6265646	retarded people have been executed...	1
3983684	A negligence case like the negligence case you just posited to Justice Stevens, that will be the only kind of situation in which there will not be immunity?	1
8934028	We are labeling this person a convicted--	1
2368247	Go ahead.	1
3066725	All right.	1
7967614	[Laughter]	1
1105637	Part of your allegation could seem to establish that, if this particular facility is... has no psychiatrist and is in a correction facility, everybody incarcerated there must be punished, I would think.	1
6897547	slots?	1
3606887	We haven't stated a number seven, 18, 32 we don't know either.	1
6726410	substantial references.	1
1555453	That's what puts it into the category of a third degree felony.	0

5695502	It may be it had in mind Torres and the problem of the person other than the one who files the notice, adding names.	1
8860244	So what's the tax   so what's the employer...	1
245974	Where would we find that?	0
9011722	--but I'm asking you a question about California law.	1
8742312	It's only what, about 5, 6 percent?	1
1805346	Well, the California court at least appears to say it's the same.	0
8967548	Ah, yes.	1
8729599	That's that's...	1
7182083	[Inaudible]	1
1406285	Did the Secretary consider alternatives?	1
4072771	That seemed to be an important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.	1
1593273	--Well, the dog sniff--	0
1000981	Would... could... could Wal-Mart have protected itself here by hanging a tag on every dress saying this is not a Samara dress?	1
5957358	though, is that the response was given in with the intent and in order to prevent a potential lawsuit.	1
671914	Well, does... does consumer--	1
1438768	Well, it was sort of a witness competency statute, wasn't it?	0
4661635	It's in the Government... the Government does do that, and it's in their interest to do that to ensure that the result of trial is upheld.	1
1187931	Yes.	0
2297625	Well, even First Amendment rights.	1
4113174	Yes.	1
3877320	ar- on the petition?	1
9226720	[Laughter]	1
1010474	It appears at page sixty-two A of the appendix to our petition.	0
440375	As far as as...	0
654324	They put all these little phone booths together and it required the management of others to know how to place them and service them and make it work.	1
2939963	But if there is no attempt to weed out the dangerous from the non-dangerous, then the claim that the object is simply to apprise the public of who is dangerous is not so credible.	1
990104	courts have done...	1
961369	Isn't there... don't you think your candidates generally feel sympathetic to people who give a lot of money to the State committee, even under the current regime?	1
3339808	A are you reading?	1
6348719	Did you... did the subcontractor here ask for a hearing?	1
2107490	I mean, the very essence of the party's First Amendment right is to define its own message and send out its own candidate.	0

4124645	And would it give the district court enough guidance?	1
2382762	Would you comment on that argument?	1
2068713	I mean, I don't see how it works.	1
1443877	On airplanes and some buses there are cupboard doors that close, so the luggage is all in there and behind the door.	1
2491681	Don't you...	1
4639351	Yes.	1
2802298	N- not necessarily.	1
1621660	That is what we look at, not the construction of the Central California project.	1
5288287	Thank you.	1
6350075	that...	1

646071	That's right, Your Honor.	0
3283022	--Is that conceded, that the principals could be instructed to vote a certain way in this organization?	1
8617093	What details?	1
5813211	Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting that there is some different standard of proof of facts in these cases or that we should not review a factual determination of a clearly erroneous rule?	1
1185146	There are limited... they have to be accompanied by, what is it, a legal guardian?	0
931895	"Yeah, the word ""knowingly""."	1
2296769	oh...	0
9589017	Mr. Braden, I... I think even if you're correct that intervention was appropriate, did the intervenors join in the appeal here?	1
3375835	Well, let me ask you this.	1
7084444	And you haven't asked us to revisit that Williamson County case, have you?	1
1158802	But you say it's not fugacious gas.	1
3547242	No.	1
2042039	The trial level court did make that decision.	0
8564663	Do you, do you contest the, I guess, intuitive assumption that if a candidate had the choice of retaining the present limits on contributions directly to that candidate, and on the other hand, having a system in which there were no contribution limits, he could accept any amount from anybody, do you, do you contest the intuitive judgment that he would probably accept the latter system and say, sure, let me accept any amount of money?	1
6439405	here. It's on-	1
4339977	They... they knew who to copy the first time.	1
1217260	Not just...	1
751994	And we're dealing here with only some of those counts?	0
8197451	[Laughter]	1
3098195	Well, it's... it's very hard to understand how appellate review can function if that first report of the special trial judge is never disclosed.	1
6343153	case...	1
2518641	Isn't he also going to have to pay the sub in this case if the State is wrong?	1
1767641	consensus.	1
2295574	Of course, the cases will always differ.	1
9597382	Which she doesn't have to say.	1
2175135	I don't know any basis for saying, you know, no harm done.	1
8112746	Thank you, Mr. Davidson.	1
3405774	should say.	1
2549444	isn't that...	1
9081042	value.	1
109028	Except the preamble is different, right?	0
336847	No canvas or solicit --	1
6680600	Well, I mean, it was clear from that study that flow would be affected, wasn't it?	1
4584087	You say then, Mr. Minear, that Mr. Davidson is wrong in citing Wyoming v. United States for the proposition that he cited it for?	1
4554381	That's what I want to know.	1
5201824	challenged. That is -- that's...	1
1646597	So... so presumably in... well in advance he could anticipate a problem.	0
6693309	That's what Penry held, didn't it?	1
6676744	Now, this case is 14 percent.	1
1357901	Did they refer to the special issues in their comment on the instructions?	1
4744008	Well, you say that they cannot be one producing zone anymore, so that if you have, let's say, a pool of methane that is surrounded by limestone, but it is contiguous to a coal bed, you wouldn't be allowed to drain... you would say they're taking away your coal, that they have no right to that methane even though it's fugacious.	1
4230716	of...	1
2213339	[Laughter]	1
1025134	Well, but that... doesn't that sort of beg the question?	1
9108038	it...	1
1839838	I--	1
1873280	So, we're concerned because he should have known that she was over 14?	0
4394158	the national forest.	1
8923988	the State does not have an interest...	1
9556062	Mr. Feldman, you have 4 minutes remaining.	1
8630577	That wasn't obvious or visible particularly to the jury.	1
7084431	[Laughter]	1
905355	In the Aerojet case.	1
7875493	has anyone...	1
2397728	The New York law?	1
4363932	The allocation regulations did not apply.	1
7601789	And what did they reveal in this area of mitigation?	1
7007310	As a result of the Federal suit?	1
5325237	Of course, we have... we have so many references to God in our daily lives in this country.	1
1509688	Does that make a difference, particularly if the governmental unit itself takes the position that it would disagree with this determination that the Boy--	0
747737	Does Treasury Regulation 79(a) bear on the extent to which Justice Breyer's example could be calculated?	1
364399	before Apprendi.	1
1966028	months.	1
3798780	In addition, this...	1
155873	All right.	0
2885747	--That last paragraph says, you proved that you disputed the assertion that it had violated.	1
8352564	I'm telling you the reg.	1
5639277	That's...	1
591514	Is that what they've done?	0
8814609	evidence.	1
724101	Do you concede that the statute is valid as to the limitation on addresses of crime victims?	0

2127645	And there's been no petition to end that one?	0
6598691	narrow range...	1
854886	But the third question that you raised was... apparently did not incorporate any consideration of the Brecht standard.	0
177718	--State action?	1
1588277	Well, it was a witness competency issue, wasn't it?	0
2239636	Now, how was that lump sum used?	0
4058396	It was a...	1
8654324	means.	1
1811048	Well, but we've said in McNeil that it's offense specific--	1
1665125	--Oh, I don't know about the Eleventh Amendment.	1
8638424	Even though some other employee on the basis of greater seniority than the respondents under the plan could take that slot?	1
1809791	We'll just let you deduct X amount.	0
7456457	[Laughter]	1
1809212	As long as something is clearly identifiable as a notice of appeal, what is it that says that errors in designating the, the details, are incurable?	1
4593356	We know what it referred to.	1
2784167	[Inaudible]	1
2752142	defendants under those circumstances.	1
8537757	concentration of businesses.	1
2605048	Oh, yes.	1
6526342	Court...	1
6979331	It looks like seven...	1
2274800	So if one of the local churches came in and said we'd like to use it one day a week to conduct our regular services, that would have to be granted as well, if it fell on a day and an hour when the school said it was open?	0
2033573	--by the FDA?	1
3102553	QED, proven.	1
5816159	And... and what are we supposed to do about that?	1
600501	If -- what has to happen is the officer must be diligent.	0
7338009	Isn't that what we're talking about here?	1
6115803	Yes, Your Honor.	1
3703373	consequence...	1
1398964	I thought the board looked both at whether it was a meritless lawsuit against the unions and whether it was for a retaliatory purpose.	0
904383	Will the community start to accept 40-minute stops?	0
4051619	Yes, but California asserts here the right to treat it as though it was all used, the money, to generate nonbusiness income.	1
2902992	[Laughter]	1
8314093	Your point is neither the one nor the other can pay... has the right under the statute or under the... to pay these past debts for food, for example.	1
8640066	Then one of the principles that EPA has applied and can derive from this statute is that transient health effects are not to be taken into account.	1
4447075	Not only that, you have...	1
209437	That doesn't tell you who is appealing.	1
1634147	We're not going to reemploy you next year.	1
6286306	How about the racetracks?	1
561872	the statute?	1
69412	Well, let's look at this very case and tell me whether the result is any different at the end of the day under Roberts versus your test.	1
327299	That phrase is the same, subject to the availability of appropriations.	1
433207	Well, except to the extent that the statute does say, all right, this property, Fort Apache, is to be held by the U.S. Government in trust for the tribe.	0
3360978	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
1963157	No, but it seemed to decide the case based on its view of the statute as just applying to generic drugs or something--	0
8426194	their employment terminated.	1
6904553	If you... if you--	1
143049	213 addresses two different uses of Federal money, hard money.	1
2991726	Thank you.	1
9527857	The investor doesn't care whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return.	1
2152313	[Inaudible]	1
3214542	Okay, so now what we have is outdoor advertising, in effect, which the State says would encourage children to smoke, so they want to restrict it.	1
6885193	I know there are lots of questions, but I want you to answer this one--	1
8720213	in...	1
9437804	Are those suits impermissible under the Eleventh Amendment?	1

9389953	Yes.	1
681014	equipment.	0
8050901	take advantage of it?	1
475784	I thought what happened here was that the lawyer found no grounds that he thought justified going further, and so advised the California courts, and did not ask to withdraw, and did not point out any so-called arguable issues.	1
2883425	If that's the problem--	1
6573740	long...	1
6051098	Isn't that really what we're saying?	1
5499300	What is our test for whether it rises to the level of punishment?	1
4845332	Which she doesn't have to say.	1
131002	trial work statute itself says that any services rendered by an individual during a period of trial work shall be deemed not to have been rendered in determining whether his disability has ceased.	1
1216421	If that's denied, you have X number of days to go to the State Supreme Court.	0
7114871	We get it from the milk sellers.	1
2233449	And so it's not possible to pick a minute in the abstract because even -- as this Court said in--	0
5157579	[Laughter]	1
2397754	--which yours don't do.	0
3739610	We can prove with expert testimony that we are cured.	1
6990390	I don't think if I read that complaint, I would read it as one that was proceeding on a veil-piercing theory.	1
6825384	The water, you've got the definition he just said.	1
6019375	1727 is there, but I don't see 1729.	1
7130418	--Stay means nothing but not go forward with.	1
7876029	Yes, but this is in some ways a sort of derivative cause of action that Trinko brings with...  with the primary injured party probably being AT&T.	1
6006438	Mr. Schaerr we did say in a case that came down rather recently in the Sapple case that South Carolina just didn't get it, it didn't pay attention to our decision in Simmons.	1
8382597	very...	1
7924265	What happens if they try to assert immunity in their Tribal Court?	1
7047990	And I thought that we had to address this facial challenge insofar as it affects the new policy.	1
2538387	So at least under the system that we have had with political parties, the political parties are accountable and are transparent.	1
7965469	Well, do you think there's no public interest in seeing to it that the defendant is tried of these very serious crimes in New York?	1
1309901	You do argue both?	1
6029108	arbitrator. The...	1
9089065	Mr. Souter's from New England.	1
2739557	But, a Tribal Court wouldn't occur to me.	1
4575109	Didn't we apply it to State courts?	1
1403241	--What... what's the fall-back?	0
6012460	I thought that it was... when Colorado, or perhaps Kansas, knew that Kansas water was being depleted, and when you were able to prove in court how much, wasn't there something in the record that until there was computer modeling you couldn't estimate with any degree of accuracy--	1
332254	I mean, why don't we go to that standard?	0
5982287	--What about a house and... and the use of a dog to sniff around a door access or a house just because the police think, you know, it's possible this is somebody growing marijuana in the basement or something?	1
2283917	the evidence.	1
6786216	--making this argument that it's inherently prejudicial even though the jury couldn't see it?	1
2879018	I think it should be the rule in normal civil cases.	1
2604367	So long as the local parties are not using the Levin Amendment, that's exactly right.	1
1186155	Do you read Allegheny as saying that the... if the State had enacted exactly the scheme that was being administered there, that it would pass equal protection review?	1
8873048	I'm not suggesting that Kansas would have been obligated to file suit, of course, in 1969, the year that it first knew or should have known, but it also seems the case that there was rather a long gap between that time and the time that Kansas actually did institute suit, and yet the Master found no undue delay.	1
5655193	Well, I I...	1
8162002	Is that what you're saying?	1
536470	Would you clarify for me why, in your petition for cert, you said that petitioner does not challenge the district court's decision to grant respondents leave to amend the complaint and to join petitioner as a new party defendant, and to do so after judgment had been rendered?	0
1985136	Well, we... we've destroyed his right of rebuttal, so--	1
6741977	Bivens should be extended is a separate question.	1
1680397	I think in the record, in the material here, we have a copy.	0
7249354	Typically, yes, that's the way 2255 works, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
2732692	How can they do that?	1
5437625	Surely the government can invite an outside group to come and give a speech or put on a presentation using government money, tuition money to ask them to do that.	1
2677252	Have we given deference to those regs in the past?	1
5778998	It doesn't have the implication that it's a waiver only as to Tribal Courts.	1
338367	It didn't enable them to address the issues by briefs, memos, or argument.	0
7807001	Yeah, and one of their charges was possession, was it not?	1
839122	Okay.	0
1861430	But I mean the funds that are paid out.	0
4601508	position.	1
5206529	That's what Penry held, didn't it?	1
1928491	Is that possible?	0
4206222	A plaintiff who's part of a class in a class action suit where attorney's fees are paid.	1
8674864	Which which it's well go ahead.	1
1185187	You don't contest post judgment interest?	1
1771248	Well, this is not a pro se petitioner.	0
3691471	Is that constitutional?	1
2208879	We don't know whether the taxpayer here was paying the minimum wage, because none of that was in the record, because the assessment amount was conceded.	0
6213282	But if...	1
149996	And section 7254 does use the word indirectly.	0
9504814	by a probation officer.	1
6860931	Why not?	1
4439548	Precisely. Precisely, Justice Souter.	1
1679634	If that's--	1
596755	May I ask you a question about that?	1
8640447	plaintiff's working history.	1
2016520	I mean that's such an odd posture in a sense it's very awkward to say the least.	1
3101583	Well, that isn't my question.	1
5700212	--Connecticut.	1
726604	Yes, Your Honor, that is exactly right.	0
1714572	--Well, and is this affected at all by the fact that the copyright had expired?	1
8567526	concession, to be sure.	1
6856393	So that might have been a pretty good deal for Mr. Moss, to get all this stuff off of radio and television, where it does a lot more harm to kids, and the risk being that the billboard prescription would be overturned.	1
18498	I mean, that seemed clear to me from Murray, and what's been omitted is a determination about whether the ineffective assistance claim was procedurally defaulted.	0
6463583	Ms. Underwood, we'll hear from you.	1
4750938	Do you have to... if you're a school that plays in this league, do you have to send somebody to this organization to vote on such things as this rule that you're objecting to?	1
8620609	This is a tribe, so they're saying by analogy it means any Tribal Court.	1
9452161	Mr.--	1
3919574	Well, there's...  there are many of things, at least, A, there was a promise that it was done, and secondly, Mr. Chief Justice, where that payphone is put, how it is managed, the appearance of the payphone, is it...  is it mechanically functioning properly.	1
8338334	So, why... I mean that's a possible reading.	1
5148540	I know.	1
4404803	--that in the State of Washington, that it is perfectly lawful to record the conversation with the police?	1
2407397	What sort of an extraordinary writ would you envision, Mr. Sarnowski?	1
1038175	Well, the... the Ninth Circuit ruling seems very broad.	0
9533547	It says they agree to arbitration in any court having jurisdiction, but it really doesn't grant anything that way.	1
442224	But I'm asking about the time within which it has to be disclosed by the broadcast stations.	0
1201159	How do we know what size of the property to look at in looking at this takings claim?	1
1392880	--I guess we upheld the right of a State to direct that primary... parties have to have a primary election rather than a caucus to select candidates.	1
2136632	So that isn't some kind of a waiver?	0
4591333	But you apparently want us to draw a different one, and what is it?	1
339052	Well, Section 1519, enacted subsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than 1512?	1
7397950	Is there anything that doesn't count?	1
1710307	At that point in time, reasonableness has nothing more to do with it because the person should be released until there is another reason, another purpose for the stop, a reasonable articulable suspicion, or you have consent.	0
2169708	worker...	1
4677403	be right. An- and it might include a...	1
1686031	Do you think that an instruction to the jury would be appropriate...	1
5131823	sex offenders...	1
6518008	Well, why is the prime's right of little value?	1
7791048	I don't know why you should take into account the latter, the secondary effect of this taking of water, and not take into account the former, the more immediate effect of it.	1
8626926	So we're not dealing with that.	1
1837993	That's all we know from looking at the statute.	0
1517056	Are... are you suggesting that some lesser notification would be adequate?	0
330398	I mean, if this were a state, we'd say it meant any state court.	1
4196902	It can be a reasonable accommodation.	1
2526342	President.	1
1665371	isn't maintained, or because it isn't a record?	1
1879303	However, when the...	1
1618515	Well, so is recklessness enough or not?	0
8447760	Well, I... I thought they would intend it in order to show special respect for the processes of the State, so that a State has completely exhausted all of its procedures for determining what the law ought to be--	1
7537533	So those funding cases are completely distinguishable...	1
5697880	--We just didn't have the money.	1
768060	Well, that's simply the Warden's position, that there are no arguable grounds.	0
5657001	And is... does any other State have such a policy, written or otherwise?	1
799701	Because you seem to be asking us to grant habeas relief, and I would have thought what we had to consider was the denial of the certificate of appealability.	0
9032473	--You say the control is by governmental institution, and the principal of the school goes to this... sits on this board, or belongs to the... by reason of the fact he's a principal.	1
3941162	That's why it said generally.	1
1580618	--I thought we had to decide whether an unnamed private party should be considered for jurisdictional purposes.	0
570755	--How about--	0
1888813	It appears at page fifty-five A of the appendix to our petition.	0
5359028	I assumed that that was how we were deciding it.	1
779583	Then can they go... start over again and go down to the trial court and the court of appeals?	0
9669853	But has the State tried to tailor it by saying we're going to prohibit it where it's near places that children congregate, schools and parks, and within a certain distance we're going to be concerned about advertising cigarettes?	1
1081333	Now, wait a minute.	1
6074964	We do...	1
8861544	If I...	1
5476208	Reply brief?	1
1953272	And now is there anything else...	1
6560486	Surely it's not in the statute that there must be a cost/benefit analysis.	1
3775692	for...	1
8124881	I'm repeating it--	1
736137	It's the interest against unreasonable delay.	0
6866700	Was there any evidence that the jury cards in this... in the actual trial were marked or noted on the basis of race?	1
3858861	--You mean to repair it or to replace it?	1
5953429	In other words, you say seizes the money due, what you mean is, it's a notice that they refuse to pay under their contract with the prime.	1
1256246	Well, Your Honor, again, the Anders obligation is actually an obligation of appellate counsel, to file an Anders brief.	0
4850537	Have... have various circuit courts approved of that?	1
1844288	And I I would I would a-	0
7570089	money...	1
5868703	Was the release the result of some order from the Federal court?	1
7829192	Maybe it's more expensive to go to school, but why does that violate his free exercise of religion right?	1
5517101	Thank you, Mr. Taylor.	1
8135033	--Back pay was attributable to '86, '87, but it's paid in '94.	1
4879699	Yes, but California asserts here the right to treat it as though it was all used, the money, to generate nonbusiness income.	1
8174383	I still would like to understand why you think an objective test is not acceptable.	1
8431993	be right. An- and it might include a...	1
5792089	Then the term, as this Court has repeatedly said, those terms are relatively fixed and understood.	1
3534777	[Laughter]	1
9626151	And a visitor wanting to stay overnight who is not a tribal member can drive on the highway right into the Cameron trading post without ever entering reservation land at all, spend the night, get up the next day, and go on up to the Grand Canyon or to Flagstaff.	1
2704047	position.	1
8983077	But one change in the statute was that the '69 statute was just based on... just applies to State laws and the '65 statute applied to State and Federal.	1
3713967	Is he an assignee automatically, because he's the subcontractor?	1
1980979	Granted.	0
5628761	Thank you, Mr. Baran.	1
4691691	cows and all that...	1
1749727	And, you know, when you read -- when you read Albright and you read Manuel, I mean, the Court is basically saying to the due process people: Stay the heck out of this area.	0
246110	Now what's the justification here for this limit?	1
2190342	But I respectfully... I respectfully refer you to the fact that the statute prohibits soliciting, receiving, transferring, directing or spending, and Congress intended meaning to those other verbs--	1
2601027	The... am I wrong about that?	1
3765456	But you think that's not sufficient?	1
2186493	sex offenders...	1
2191439	Yes.	1
5825383	It's an odd position when you say there was no obligation whatever for the State to allow slot machines at racetracks, but if they allow it, they have to be as generous to the racetrack as they were to the riverboats.	1
6792008	--could you--	1
5211143	so we wouldn't be in this mess?	1
8130116	I mean, these are things that happen all the time, and I wonder if the Jenson line isn't the correct line to look to.	1
1055603	Why not go lower?	1
3317758	Let me ask you one other...	1
221015	So in this case, then did that question go to the jury, the qualified immunity issue?	0
5907502	Don't you hand out that...	1
5088503	That is a perfect accommodation, in our view, of the state interest, of the state interest in regulating its own electoral affairs.	1
6574493	Well, this is where... I mean, exact... I enter into a contract to have my house built, but the prime is going to have subs.	1
1186238	Now, one other housekeeping sort of question.	0
8179968	barred.	1
946089	One, the Petitioner has failed to state a discrete constitutional claim based upon fabricated evidence. This Court has been clear that where a 1983 claim alleges an absence of probable cause, including where fabricated evidence is used, all of the pretrial deprivations of liberty that go hand in hand with the criminal prosecution are encompassed in the Fourth Amendment.	0
2912539	It would be terrible if you said they're not covered for Social Security purposes simply because the employer never paid them their wages and they got it all in one lump sum after they were 50 years old.	1
2189618	But it doesn't include States?	0
3033953	But they... the Megan's Laws are not all one size and shape.	1
149382	That's going back...	1
248013	So what kind of a seniority plan is that? I mean, on the one hand you say, we have to apply our seniority plan, but on the other hand, it isn't enforceable.	0
4738990	--What... is there anything you can say that can, in the light--	1
4221376	So the rule you would have us follow does result in a... a super technicality in a sense of what... what was on the record at the time of the plea.	1
300402	back to...	1
146715	--post PLRA and until the termination of the suit?	0
5714262	Is pen and ink it a term you have coined for this case?	1
1139720	Why?	1
1062147	even even if the British Nationality can be read as saying that corporations formed in the British Virgin Island are not citizens, it doesn't say they're not subjects of the United Kingdom, does it?	1
3551962	We can say you've changed the law and therefore it's ex post facto, but we don't decide for ourselves over the... overruling a State court what that particular law said at a particular time.	1
2144418	Is there any question that if the State board did, in fact, instruct the principals by passing a general standard that would be applicable to these athletic contests that the principals would be bound to follow the State board's rule?	1
623816	--If it is the end of the traffic stop, it is not.	0
1267290	they're not...	0
7944691	that...	1
9418532	I think...	1
6137027	So I mean, your... your position, as I understand it, is that... that this determinant point is not necessary to satisfy the delegation doctrine, and the... and as you have just said, the question of reasonableness or capriciousness is not before us because it was never reached by the court below.	1
4480961	--the welfare standards, wouldn't it?	1
1878345	As long as the person, the officer, is diligently working towards the mission--	0
7361168	Well, but B...	1
9372954	What didn't come in as a discrete item came in as part of the whole gambling operation.	1
2821117	Although I don't --	1
783047	Well, that's what I'm trying to press you on a little bit, because the findings in some instances are in areas that are under traditional State control.	0
5538241	contingency...	1
3710675	Adopting that definition, I don't see how more than about 1 percent, if that, could be flood water, water that would have overflowed the banks of the San Joaquin or any other of these dry places.	1
13173	Well, how many States that use the death penalty allow future dangerousness as a factor in sentencing?	0
6709093	[Inaudible]	1
6851212	there was reasonable...	1
6334222	Mr. Mashburn, you have three minutes remaining.	1
6065907	It says, no statement relating to smoking and health shall be required.	1
7789741	cases.	1
3063361	Well, let's just try to boil it down a little bit for my purposes.	1
2087192	Is this a situation where the state has just turned its back and said, we don't care?	1
1574802	Prisons has...	1
8629768	where...	1
5879706	Would such cases merit a CPC?	1
8942132	Yeah, it's the highway department purchasers.	1
2315766	Am I right?	0
1165112	The court asks again, do you understand that?	0
7417707	And it's possible that some of the courts have lowered the bar too much on the functionality inquiry.	1
1198907	And that's because these people were tried, convicted, served their time before the passage of the act.	1
2430302	And what... what are the issues before the court there?	1
2354056	Well, yes, but is it... is it the case that most courts are holding, under the scheme I described, that not only while the court is deciding it, but the time allowed to enable them to go to the next higher court is excluded as well?	0
8377132	It's...	1
6656416	Why don't you focus on the statement and tell us why it would or would not be different?	1
6235648	You're telling me it's not property until you go into court?	1
3550662	One of those problems might be the existence of records for the purpose to apply this apportionment rule.	1
260568	In other words, reasonable probability.	1
2988789	And that goes for the smokeless tobacco and cigars as well?	1
5794407	Maybe.	1
7079352	But another to do it is to say that so long as the water that's sometimes in that canal and running out through the crack that was too big is flood water, so long as that's so, as long as that's a substantial amount of the water that's causing the damage, i.e. as long as a substantial amount is water that would have otherwise gone into the San Joaquin River but did not because there is too much water behind the dam and the river was filled up, as long as that's substantial, the Government's entirely immune.	1
128128	What is it here, 1,000--	1
4356587	Well, I I just...	1
4476798	--Stay means nothing but not go forward with.	1
9273599	Is the Super Scoop practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?	1
8720449	Concept.	1
624179	May I--	0
5217234	What is... is there any... do you have any response to this claim that the high recidivism rate itself supports the argument that, in fact, this is nothing but a safety information kind of measure, whereas broadcasting all criminal convictions would not be justified as having a good fit between the object and what the State was doing?	1
6955841	Miranda itself was from a State court.	1
5912357	question entirely, sir.	1
195688	on it did have it...	1
1604295	Yes, Your Honor.	0
7345014	this area.	1
2282624	What is that?	1
3806945	And some members of the Court were rather critical of that particular development, I would say.	1
397080	You have no exceptions, in your view.	0
5334888	I'm not suggesting that Kansas would have been obligated to file suit, of course, in 1969, the year that it first knew or should have known, but it also seems the case that there was rather a long gap between that time and the time that Kansas actually did institute suit, and yet the Master found no undue delay.	1
2696475	there.	1
4907500	I'm frankly attracted to the latter approach.	1
1447616	Is that what's being asserted?	0
7504287	[Laughter]	1
8143368	--what it was the Ninth Circuit panel said.	1
4993739	[Laughter]	1
1138560	Well, what about attorney's fees in class actions?	1
1016292	Would you talk about what the system is here, because I found it a little hard to understand.	1
1055900	Thank you.	1
146861	So what's a takings claimant supposed to do?	0
5407795	Well--	1
4442831	Well, what is the best indication that in those subsequent legislation, in the subsequent legislation reserving gas to the Government, that it intended the gas to include the coalbed methane?	1
1408424	That seems sort of inconsistent with your view on the second question that trial work periods shouldn't begin until the end of the twelve months.	0
1994882	Are there instances where plaintiffs in lawsuits end up receiving tax bills, as a result of this scheme, for more money than they received in the lawsuit?	1
8918007	The burden, of course, is...	1
7302765	I mean, that's what I--	1
3340966	a danger for --	1
4655201	Is that correct?	1
891452	And so we don't get beyond all these other things.	0
8157048	I sh- I sure do.	1
8588347	Is he an assignee automatically, because he's the subcontractor?	1
4774362	It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market.	1
5845280	Absolutely not.	1
2315438	Mr. McCormick, why isn't there a categorization problem in this case?	1
924773	So... so presumably in... well in advance he could anticipate a problem.	0
9664155	Yeah.	1
1235835	You can show that the--	1
5086116	So at least as to those women I don't see a protective purpose.	1
4196595	How about member owned hotels?	1
6366931	What's your case authority for the proposition you just stated, Mr. Sutton?	1
4458117	He can give, in California, $10,000 to each of the 58 California county committees and $10,000 to the California state committee for a total of $590,000 in California.	1
3379366	Too bad.	1
2945520	Who would have thought that?	1
1871290	I got pulled over for a driving offense, then it -- it -- then it is over.	0
2297955	Explain to me whether we've ever bifurcated forum immunity from immunity for suit... from suit?	1
4182209	[Laughter]	1
1870020	might have brought.	1
1678100	And this Court said that could comply with the Fourth Amendment?	0
5982244	Can you articulate the rule that you want?	1
3782426	--So, is that enough in... in the view of the Government?	1
4080093	Congress says should be done.	1
6917898	I suppose any candidate would feel sympathetic to someone who was agreed to give $80,000 to the State party, which he knows will be used to support him even though not in coordination with him.	1
38670	I mean, if your client wanted to go into Tribal Court to enforce it, I wouldn't have thought Montana would be a barrier.	1
2390891	forth, but...	0
6644137	Consent...	1
9216637	The INS...	1
8876400	But there was other evidence of future dangerousness.	1
5437261	May I ask this...	1
1046425	Explain to me whether we've ever bifurcated forum immunity from immunity for suit... from suit?	1
8722142	Yes, and I guess that isn't before us--	1
1215957	plaintiff's working history.	1
5557771	That's your--	1
6932643	And you ha-	1
3584587	But it may not be self-executing.	1
7494926	That's something we ought to consider.	1
2630479	But do you--	1
1510750	It's not...	1
2077571	[Laughter]	1
4368246	--plan participants at all times?	1
7748921	same law.	1
2261031	Mr. Kilberg, the Washington supreme court seems to have analyzed the decedent's life insurance policy separately from the pension plan in doing the preemption analysis.	0
1522889	Mr. Sarnowski, can I ask you about your interpretation of 2253?	1
2035460	entirely...	1
2171277	Well, maybe the price that has to be paid for professionals to set up a professional corporation is to be subject to the ADA, and the anti-discrimination law of title VII, and so forth, because these people are going to be counted.	1
4450045	Yes.	1
3888507	i-	1
4777510	allow the Federal circuit...	1
6827304	Now, this case is 14 percent.	1
4860627	--and... and upset what's going on all across the country?	1
339475	Yes, and we have held that a state can abandon sovereignty, as in Massachusetts versus New York.	0
734840	[Inaudible]	1
451504	Well, then, how do you deal with the Doyle case?	0
7623916	Well, you can't square that with the Near case at all.	1
1082425	--making this same argument?	0
2312624	What is wrong with 323(b) in the First Amendment realm is that it does restrict the ability of state and local parties, as well as national parties to pool their resources.	1
8187	else.	0
6262174	No.	1
3030347	I --	1
2279151	I know.	1
8038286	The subject matter jurisdiction?	1
1873536	That gets us into a whole new doctrine.	1
7297565	Treasury regs adopted by... how, notice and comment rulemaking?	1
7742227	So long as the local parties are not using the Levin Amendment, that's exactly right.	1
8942287	"""in a way that says don't impose the death penalty any way. """	1
1504293	[Laughter]	1
1407052	Well, with respect to the cases at the margin, the Court articulated the same kind of analysis that the Securities and Exchange Commission does.	1
1325565	Well, do we look to general Federal common law agency principles, or are we bound by State agency law, Mr. Stewart?	1
4576211	But can I...	1
4670193	Are we bound by that determination?	1
994393	You sued the prime?	1
7494636	is the employer--	1
3972214	I have only been here a limited time, but I have never seen a state government make this argument.	1
7841092	But -- this...	1
2840310	[Laughter]	1
1307133	Yes.	0
1470113	And the district court did not deal with individual immunity allegations?	1
2079765	Could the jury verdict be upheld here even if the Court agreed with your view?	1
9425407	How about if you cite at least a... a reported case that has decided the claim on a Federal basis?	1
436109	They just go into the pool in time.	0
8794378	Let me ask you one other...	1
5587074	It is a device that measures heat.	1
8889892	indictment.	1
839185	She said these things are worse, and we are banning them.	1
113844	But I'm asking you.	1
7907462	It does seem to me that the... that your primary purpose does not give the Government quite enough protection, because a major purpose, part of the major design of this entire system is for flood control purposes.	1
865599	ability to order...	0
4553862	Okay.	1
2036142	Well, I'm not sure.	1
5792053	All right.	1
5206860	--No, but we're talking about flood water, and the flood water the Chief Justice just pointed out, he gave that definition, and I was saying it seemed to me that 98 percent... I'll give you at the moment that the canal is part of a flood control project.	1
513854	Why isn't that a pure access issue?	0
1443464	And ever since Oregon v. Elstad, which said it didn't apply to fruits, all the courts of appeals in the Federal circuits, but one, have said it comes in.	1
665826	Now --	0
8922523	[Laughter]	1
6616940	Can you explain, because this goes to the heart of, I think, of our understanding of your case, why your argument relates to delegation as opposed to the arbitrary and capricious stand, the point at which we ended up with... with your brother.	1
414704	convicted?	1
6581135	Tell me whether the result would differ under your proposal and under Roberts in this very case.	1
1050446	Is that a problem?	0
1387797	Is... is there anything from this Court?	1
7659045	think...	1
1993757	Can it... with respect to the reasonableness aspect, in Turner versus Safley, we said prison administrators have a good deal of latitude, in the prison context, in order to maintain order.	0
3341518	Well, but it seemed apparently to just include selection of electors in the general election law provisions.	1
196990	Well, let me ask you this.	0
1455962	for your position to prevail here, do we have to overrule Ex parte Bain or somehow set that aside, which seems to suggest that if it's not in the indictment, it's a jurisdictional problem?	1
6909843	And they, but the the the likelihood...	1
4765169	What possible interest would the prison have in prohibiting... assuming you allowed an inmate to provide legal services to another, which sometimes I understand happens, what interest of the prison is there in making sure that it is never done in written form, which the prison can then read?	1
3242832	--Well, if that were the case, then all cigarette advertising would simply have brand names, or the photographs of the cigarette packages, and it would not have people in cowboy suits or people in bars or people in beaches doing sophisticated and healthy things, and that's just not the way the advertising is--	1
9183942	notes as well.	1
581514	challenged. That is -- that's...	1
8110480	Well, maybe you... maybe you should tell us later, and proceed.	1
3342022	What about it?	1
6077333	The first half he says is that you look to see whether the underlying claim is a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right, but, he says, if the procedural ruling was, you know, rolling off a log, there's no doubt about its correctness, you don't get a certificate of appealability.	1
1196355	Yes.	1
5481246	Well, you... you have two problems here really.	1
5473310	Do you agree that it is a totality of the circumstances test?	1
8395135	Are they all after 1953?	1
2717012	--on the legal incidence of the tax, we suggested, in the Chickasaw Nation case, that a tax statute's own declaration of the legal incidence would be dispositive.	1
4815902	Is that the same as active inducement--	1
911640	Well, is there some burden on the part of the prosecutor and the court to consider at least alternative restraints or measures to make sure that there's no misbehavior?	0
5015727	--Mr. Waters, are you... suppose the Court were to agree with your position, are you seeking any kind of retroactive relief here?	1
1301956	But he never says anything.	0
816395	Your Honor, we have briefed this matter, and after due consideration, we believe that this statute can and should be struck down consistent with the Buckley line of cases.	1
5489957	Has it had some effect there--	1
6472492	And so what we've done is introduced a little curlicue and told all the lawyers, by the way, it's when you file the petition in the district court, but for the CPC, and eventually I guess that word would get out.	1
9547727	Well, Mr. Favish, now, the court below didn't really rest on that ground, did it?	1
384216	Right, and that was rejected by this Court in Chandris.	0
4814728	What is the difference between a present property interest in my employment and a present property interest in the money that you owe me?	1
868397	It was a procedural...	1
4535833	In... in preclearing, does the Government look at the effect as a whole?	1
8081747	last twenty years? I count two.	1
6841379	If this thing is so confusing, how's the business person supposed to know what they can do?	1
8368192	You know I I...	1
8525054	Is it the case that it would violate the Occupational Safety and Health Act for Chevron to hire this person under those circumstances?	1
1591316	Mr. Comey, I think you rely, in part at least, on this Court's case in Whren--	0
5457204	Now, what prevents that from happening, once we get into the habit of awarding prejudgment interest?	1
6197515	But when you read the Federal statute, it does seem to be directed more toward what has to be on cigarette labels than anything else.	1
8773938	No, I--	1
6382890	the city did not study the combination but, rather, relied on judicially approved statutory precedent from other jurisdictions.	1
818506	Well, maybe they better re-read it.	0
2033378	--What would you think of a case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning was the... was caused by racial discrimination against the applicant?	0
5029583	Isn't there some initial assessment that must be made?	1
4244363	In fact, they rejected them.	1
994960	I understand.	1
5246086	So at least as to those women I don't see a protective purpose.	1
2030801	--Does it depend in part on how we define functionality under the trade dress inquiry?	0
9007025	I thought the statute required that committee to advise the EPA of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of the national standards.	1
5552325	You say the riverboats, obviously, are located on the rivers which bound Iowa on the east and on the west.	1
7432834	I thought the principals instruct the other people in the schools.	1
5351671	And what are the other examples of Congress' choice to regulate States alone, exclusively under the Commerce Clause power, rather than general legislation?	1
9600426	Well, you you...	1
6794461	Why couldn't it?	1
8706734	It did so after the petitioner had filed a petition that made reference to some of the cases that address the question whether a signed notice of appeal could be... whether a signing constituted typing.	1
6519639	And what did they reveal in this area of mitigation?	1
2359776	Well, that's true, but I must say when your response to the... one of your responses to the allegation of racial districting is, no, this was incumbent protection, and when the incumbent you're trying to protect is an incumbent who was elected from an unconstitutionally constituted district, that is the prior district which was held to be unconstitutional, I think that the defense of incumbent protection just washes out to say you're going to protect this incumbent means you're going to make sure that the person who was elected by racial gerrymandering will continue to be elected.	1
532736	Yes.	0
1546265	I can't see much difference.	0
4918877	would result in...	1
1460758	Can... has the tribe asked, administratively, for the Bureau of Indians Affairs to recognize it now as a tribe?	0
4937928	Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.	1
5605825	I'd als-	1
1372899	It was under a different act, not the Pittman Act, but certainly very similar.	0
7109510	No, we're not saying that.	1
1570869	Let me ask you, if we reach the question of what standards to apply, it doesn't fit comfortably in any setting with which we're familiar, strict scrutiny, rational basis test.	0
8828207	What about notice, notice to these respondents?	1
9415840	Now you tell me how to read it to get to the place that you want to get to.	1
2728287	The taxpayers of the State of Colorado will end up footing the bill, and it just seems odd to me that we would all of a sudden craft some rule allowing prejudgment interest against a sovereign State.	1
1603584	How long was it in effect?	0
7519933	Well, the attorneys for the Federal agencies dealing with it certainly took that position.	1
2416606	Yes, here we think there has to be discovery.	1
448775	--on the basis that the respondent was employed as the investment advisor for this plan--	1
449871	We don't know whether the taxpayer here was paying the minimum wage, because none of that was in the record, because the assessment amount was conceded.	0
947512	But, just tell me, what went to the jury?	0
434410	Knowing that the State regime will spend a lot of money to help them in one way or another, coordinated or not?	1
2631940	In addition, this...	1
6040400	And you have no problem with, in God we trust, on the coins and that sort of thing?	1
2388585	the FCC didn't and why the statute...	0
3244932	Mr. Pescetta, you have 3 minutes remaining.	1
148768	Yes, but we're over the point of getting paid for the litigation, and we're talking I think only about these endless monitoring arrangements, these open-ended, ongoing monitoring arrangements.	1
9195554	You think that counsel's performance was adequate here?	1
537013	Well, it is for the very reasons we've explored this morning.	0
1869554	When the prime withholds, the prime generally assigns to the sub the right to litigate for the money with the agency, with the contracting agency.	1
9119795	Mr. Baran.	1
4128219	do here? We have a case here where, as I understand it, there were three prior complaints by the employer that resulted in some form of disciplinary action.	1
2536681	Well you're...	1
4314071	large...	1
336120	--Well, why shouldn't we apply--	0
2522203	Which?	1
456516	That just came out of no place.	0
376089	instruction and guidance.	1
8836030	and not...	1
6293924	[Laughter]	1
3061121	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
1485197	Well, Your Honor...	0
4989766	Well, again it's not a question of not paying attention; it's a question of whether it can be cured, whether we know that the thirty days can't be cured once that runs, but the... the question is whether something like the signature shouldn't be curable, when everything is there, his name is... is in the caption, his name is in the body of the notice.	1
345289	That's that's...	1
7658515	What doesn't it say?	1
5065792	Yes.	1
3260030	[Laughter]	1
7675741	Do we owe any deference to the agency here in its interpretation?	1
3180317	And the record somewhere discloses this?	1
3495639	But it... the statute, though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's fees, isn't it?	1
289557	--on regarded as?	0
1244447	Then can they go... start over again and go down to the trial court and the court of appeals?	0
8783917	Have... have various circuit courts approved of that?	1
8632771	Is that your position?	1
5479078	So then you are making the distinction that... that Mr. Sutton suggested you were... that this is a requirement... the signing requirement... this jurisdictional signing requirement applies only to pro se litigants and not to litigants with counsel.	1
6997993	You say, you couldn't do it under the labor code.	1
7374823	of Congress' choice under the Commerce Clause power to regulate exclusively the States.	1
1166970	I mean, if it's...  this was for the benefit of the court presumably, and the court says, I don't need it, thank you.	0
2042223	Is there some... do you say there is some absolute right to have the Federal court hear unexhausted claims?	0
5620484	Yes.	1
1452635	ASM.	0
46130	[Laughter]	1
759264	This is occupied by the Fourth Amendment. So the problem that the Petitioner has is most, if not all, of his claim has been dismissed.	0
258347	I mean...	1
621701	--I think when a traffic stop is occurring, when an officer has someone stopped, we don't expect them to ignore potential evidence of criminal behavior.	0
4524671	53.	1
9063687	So in your view this case boils down to whether section 3501 is sufficient--	1
8804278	Why isn't a rule that says you can't advertise at all a rule that prohibits claims based on smoking and health?	1
5051764	This Court said that might, indeed, be the law in Penry, but you say we were wrong there.	1
3601827	So long as the local parties are not using the Levin Amendment, that's exactly right.	1
267994	Okay.	0
7634610	Very well, Mr. Jones.	1
1588150	He's relying on... that's why you have an expert witness, to some extent, upon the credibility of the expert witness.	1
6641882	Why don't you simply say that all that Lindh held was that the substantive requirements are governed by a nonretroactive principle, and what nonretroactivity means for the substantive requirements is that you apply them to all cases.	1
8096046	This was a small apartment, was it?	1
45021	In light of that case.	0
1342654	Well, Your Honor, actually his argument is that he thought he was going to get 3-1/2 years, and there is simply no support for that.	0
6964410	--Well, but not in this case.	1
3441282	Well, litigation...	1
4604309	Suppose I believe a life sentence is appropriate but I don't believe a life sentence as reflected by a negative answer to a finding to the issue under consideration; I don't believe it is appropriate as reflected by deliberation; I don't believe it is appropriate as reflected by lack of dangerousness.	1
1086620	That is something that you can do as a reviewing court, because the facts have been established.	0
7821666	[Laughter]	1
4775848	So at least where it's marketed to the public you would say it's covered, at least that, even though you don't know backing up where to cut it off?	1
5204108	That's -- that's exactly --	1
5394834	before you.	1
1607030	Well, that goes to the issue on remand if there is one.	0
7883555	Mr. Denvir, in this case it does seem that the Ninth Circuit just didn't apply the Strickland standard in judging this...	1
8225868	That is the assumption--	1
4719122	[Laughter]	1
1889053	--Why don't you tell us?	1
3574831	Well, so can it be brought as a 1983 action?	1
8357106	--So, even if, are there, is there a Tribal Court?	1
2132159	can assume that if...	1
2193864	Are you taking coal?	1
4017375	think...	1
7976149	You can't have certain words in it.	1
5327139	Is it federal law, state law or tribal law or all three?	1
759492	It's not a search.	0
1755591	I guess--	1
1457787	You should actually be grateful for this--	1
8910690	Is there some tension between the knew or should have known in '69, and the no undue delay for a lawsuit that wasn't filed for 17 years?	1
8711233	Yes.	1
1149707	So coughs don't count?	1
1796917	It just seemed to kind of bypass it and assume that all those changes and deadlines were just fine and they would go ahead and adhere to them, and I found that troublesome.	0
33457	Federal law, and as a policy matter we generally look to State law? But isn't that itself a question of Federal law, the extent to which we're going to look to State law?	1
9086897	No, no, that would be State action, and it would have to comport with due process.	1
7660873	Sorry.	1
1606972	If so, how?	0
7265555	Assume you lose in this Court on the interpretation of the contract, I take it that the tribe would say that they're immune from suit in their own court as well.	1
1797995	conduct-	1
1632508	--adjudicating the correctness of the application of rules for wholesale rates that are contained of thousands or millions of words filed before the Federal Power Commission.	1
3710660	Justice O'Connor asked the question, suppose the trier of fact found 100 percent of the water, or let's say, 98 percent of the water over the last 10 years in Madera Canal has been for irrigation purposes only, any difference in the case?	1
7940989	Suppose everything is the same, except that the organization is only for public schools, and only public schools compete in these competitions.	1
4192815	opportunity.	1
6098502	And That's the only claim we have before this Court...	1
4950622	Can I ask you about--	1
27230	Would it? That wouldn't make any sense.	0
8697813	area...	1
745256	Well I thought that this was that circumstance of benefits.	1
683085	when the g-	1
531730	--I assume that because you're here--	1
566520	[Laughter]	1
5252857	We are there. Good.	1
373820	Custody is a Fourth Amendment concept, and that would -- that type of a claim, that type of damage, would come under the Fourth Amendment umbrella under the constitutional division of labor that this Court set forth in Footnote 8 of Manuel.	0
291203	Wouldn't you apply the same rule?	1
2581512	--the basis for your statement that Congress assumed that immunity would apply when it did this particular project?	1
314260	Yeah.	0
1222424	time.	1
3482973	But, this contract does refer to application of the rules of the American Arbitration Association and it makes some reference to the state act.	1
3032220	I mean, I I in other words I s-	1
7048180	Now, have we...  have we, in looking at funding issues, have we dealt differently with the requirement of funding something out of public funds than for other purposes?	1
5801489	A catch-all must catch all.	1
3676719	before Apprendi.	1
9017091	Wouldn't you like to see it if it went against you?	1
507366	But these tenants didn't let it get to that stage.	0
8221242	Okay.	1
1388908	The second key section is thirty-one eleven.	0
1720874	If you can find some religious group that espouses drinking beer every day or other alcoholic beverages or taking certain amounts of marijuana or no telling what or having certain clothing or other things that would alter the conditions of the prison environment, there's a real incentive here to get religion.	0
5935056	just a minute here.	1
4102855	Well, but of course, there's been a couple of centuries of practice in this country of not funding religious instruction by tax money.	1
3016015	Treasury regs adopted by... how, notice and comment rulemaking?	1
148679	Do you know what exemption is urged?	0
8562162	Does it fall under the fighting words notion, or is it a separate category of constitutionally proscribable speech do you suppose?	1
3442097	comes into play is if you speak...	1
5588791	Your opponent says the line is whether it's an evidentiary change or a sufficiency of the evidence change.	1
9053052	The honorable Court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.	1
1292062	We haven't done that, and...	1
5128805	certainly forty to sixty...	1
4064236	I I...	1
6206416	to State law...	1
5761275	But I did have a question direct--	1
1292245	And we have said that section 5 prevents retrogression.	0
4338611	So that what we do will make no difference in the... in the ultimate result in this case.	1
7512600	Amendment rights. It would be an artifice.	1
6620161	Well, Justice Stevens, I can answer this by saying that the seminal case, Howey, referred to and cited Blue Sky cases and Federal court of appeals decisions, which did contain those type of instruments, fixed return instruments.	1
5992887	--It isn't clear from Williamson County that this Court envisioned two... two separate determinations of fact issues: one in State court and one in Federal.	1
519573	It appeared to be the assumption that the Oneidas did not have to go to Kansas, if they chose not to do it.	1
1093625	If it can go to the court of appeals, but this is -- I mean, you have the question that it was based on a hunch, but you give the discretion to the magistrate who heard the evidence.	0
1490764	And and at that wi- i- d- is it also true, as I think you allege, that the seniority policy does not create legally enforceable rights in any employee? No employee wanting to come in would be able to sue to get that enforced.	0
6375430	Obviously, where you have a Social Security statute, and people are supposed to be covered, you're going to make a big effort to allocate this backwards, because if you didn't, it would mean that the statute wouldn't serve its basic purpose.	1
8545407	Well, if it includes state court, then they have said shall be specifically enforceable in any state court.	1
8586222	fuel program but but...	1
6348985	proceedings.	1
8808533	Well, would you say that a ship coming in at a port in our country from elsewhere cannot be searched thoroughly without reasonable suspicion?	1
1091587	--Well, do you take the position that no land use management plan can ever give rise to an obligation to any portion of the public to do certain things that the plan says will be done by date X?	0
1956562	The question this case presents is how the commissioner carries out his obligation under sixty-two oh one to assess the tax that is imposed by section thirty-one eleven.	0
8042034	I'm telling you the reg.	1
716288	Mr. Kerrigan, has the California law changed since this case came about?	0
6403109	answer, and the board and the board cannot know in advance--	1
346455	That's what we're reviewing.	0
1412278	I mean, that's an incredibly large figure.	1
6554800	system.	1
5408339	But I... but I do think that that's the more natural--	1
1527143	Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate?	0
1133434	Well, does that have the effect of negating the safe-harbor provision, in your view?	0
8996746	But we're talking about border searches with customs officials who are trained and they have limited budgets.	1
4963458	Well, the California Supreme Court, in announcing under State law, didn't give it that fundamental sweep at all.	1
6780763	Congress says should be done.	1
2485349	Isn't it pretty darn specific in identifying courts by reference to a certain subject matter?	1
2360790	And the Court denied it.	0
8061961	--That's right, broader.	1
2173661	in the FCC?	0
899427	[Inaudible]	1
4489400	There's...	1
1678330	Has he been on supervised release or not?	0
1797913	Well,	0
3000654	Not in this case, in all cases.	1
7639250	actually where the Court has to go.  Because...	1
7065126	Now, let's just take that as an example.	1
6189057	the burden.	1
7421780	There is one exception...	1
3486021	We don't have to get into that.	1
7817466	Right.	1
8590279	Suppose everything is the same, except that the organization is only for public schools, and only public schools compete in these competitions.	1
8856473	Don't assume it's my position.	1
84798	We submit that the teachings of the decision of this Court...	1
7883739	First page of the blue brief?	1
2470833	I'm...	1
975799	Here there was a prompt filing at the trial court level for habeas, State habeas.	0
3008905	I would say it has to be exclusive reference under the Siebold regime, Your Honor.	1
568853	Telecommunications, we we don't have a position.	0
2695385	Wasn't there also a request for funds?	1
853095	They preempted it and filed some kind of a suit to get an injunction before there had ever been a proceeding.	0
6854808	Well, but we've said in McNeil that it's offense specific--	1
318450	What page?	1
9123840	has an aggregate at that point, some that appears from the credit cards to have been paid out in tips, no matter how it's...	1
4527620	So Mr. Phillips was right, then, in his statement to me that there had been no technological change during that period of time.	1
8363345	--But he did make that assertion, you're not saying that the court--	1
5588485	Because it seems to me that would have certainly a bearing on the case.	1
3193481	A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market.	1
4739629	You refer to prior cases, and you say, a State court ordered G & G and DLSE to mediate, and a settlement was reached.	1
9646653	But does he describe the development of the technology in this period?	1
7705470	And of course--	1
93180	[Laughter]	1
9349136	But not only did the Court in Howey cite those two Blue Sky cases that involved fixed returns, but the Court cited then four...  and we mention these, I'll not go through the names again here, we mention them in our briefs...  four court of appeals decisions that had involved no pooling of interest and there...  there have been two SEC formal adjudications, which again, as I said, this Court gives deference to.	1
2291881	--That's right.	0
7707765	--Under the Florida legislative scheme?	1
4280736	[Laughter]	1
7725323	sure. It...	1
930937	person is entitled at the end of the five months.	1
7749633	Right,	1
1335447	I mean, that's a fact question, possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose.	1
1659987	Let me ask, in the context of this very case, the officer sought summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue.	0
9427653	They were not...	1
1636377	The--	1
6675575	They're... they're... suspicious people against whom there are suspicions are more likely to commit crimes than people who are not suspected.	1
4197616	Does it matter how... how much you have to take apart of a car to make a search?	1
4291088	That was...	1
9091892	And let me ask you, is it often that roadblocks are set up just to get information like this?	1
9399627	The--	1
1759471	isn't maintained, or because it isn't a record?	1
2117882	The honorable Court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.	1
1148523	But if there is newly discovered evidence that comes... is discovered after that initial 21-day period, are State collateral proceedings available to establish the facts?	0
950086	It's a little odd in this Pittman Act because it... it does in section 8 refer to valuable minerals, but at various other times in the act, it just says minerals.	0
1318923	--Well, I presume--	1
2891335	Nothing else is relevant.	1
875244	It would depend, I suppose, on how the program was structured, what the inquiry involving a compelling government...  strict scrutiny would entail.	1
3918990	When you go beyond I'm sorry.	1
6525626	Not as to a Federal officer, correct.	1
4495387	that under Apprendi, the the quantity may become an element, in effect.	1
9500649	Mr. Minear, where do we find the best map showing the boundaries of the land in question?	1
8526090	Thank you, Mr. McCormick.	1
620643	I think Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act, and it told States they couldn't tax these Internet transactions for a period of time, can't do it.	0
9445660	If that's -- is that...	1
2099973	--I see why we're... is this the point of what I consider our miscommunication.	1
4688864	But But...	1
8558819	I w- I I will defer...	1
5615501	--And in fact, as we have set forth in our reply brief, we believe that we do win if even the more complacent standard is applied.	1
6693745	But on a theory that there's a new flood.	1
399620	--task towards the offense.	0
3075233	The assertion was that if there was no commerce clause connection, it would be unconstitutional, and that's what the discussion was about, a sufficient commerce clause connection.	1
1513670	Yes.	1
1424395	So how do you distinguish Morrison?	1
3103989	The... the statute says, pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause.	1
2151032	shared.	1
4771215	yeah but any   DSM --	1
1465789	Congress adopted that.	0
6401244	If the one is incorporated, why isn't the other?	1
6940035	What's so important about having the coverage question of what quarters are covered for beneficiaries and the tax question of where you pay the FICAs, who cares whether they conform or not?	1
4325949	[Laughter]	1
4551295	You can answer that yes or no, I think.	1
6698955	Why is that?	1
5992851	--And maybe that--	1
6924176	It's perfectly clear that eventually AEDPA will apply to all appeals.	1
168101	whether this is harmless error?	0
9055801	very, very -- Oh...	1
7993120	I mean, all that would show... all you're claiming is that some people who are not dangerous are... are wrongly covered by this regulatory measure.	1
5429860	[Laughter]	1
8164630	All right--	1
3536540	What was being discussed in McCleskey was a constitutional right, so it makes perfectly good sense there to talk about... that language wasn't intended to cover the whole scope of habeas.	1
7225781	Under your view, all of the rules and regulations are now the rules of the State actor, and parochial schools are members of this body.	1
8809903	And that issue was raised by them in the tribal court, right?	1
3578370	Whereabouts on page nine A?	1
4803810	Okay.	1
2405462	Right.	1
3686591	Mr. Everett, can I ask kind of a basic question, prompted by Justice Scalia's question.	1
1880975	Now, the court below didn't deal with the Privileges and Immunities issue, right?	0
1766814	Prohibiting the Republican National Committee from, from, from raising money consistent with the state law in Virginia and donating millions of dollars in 2001 in the state elections in Virginia, there's no Federal interest in that.	1
293088	How long was it in effect?	0
7145129	Yeah, they...	1
7678392	court found...	1
6938599	That...	1
5588838	beginning with the first...	1
4497438	Did not know in fact?	1
5886053	What's the standard rule for allocating?	1
593474	give an ex-	1
1967347	But we really haven't equated section 2 challenges with section 5 challenges.	0
3595502	May I ask you if you think the congressional findings might have been phrased a little differently if they'd been made after the Seminole decision?	1
2788064	It's h- It puts you in a bad position for me to ask you this, but just assume, if you would for a minute, that we think Strickland applies.	1
7769345	And somebody comes along and knows the regulation is there but says, look, that regulation is going to have to be applied in a reasonable manner, I'm going to pay you X amount for this property and then challenge it.	1
4437269	depending...	1
9049870	no.	1
5058426	i-	1
8923190	Or a noncontact visit?	1
1785454	Okay.	0
9452566	Therefore, substance, not form or title, governs.	1
663600	--It's always been interesting for that reason, so I just thought, well, gee, that's what this case is about.	1
43378	--also had a similar ban, as I understand it.	1
1836506	I'm not sure how important this is, but what you just said suggests this to me, that there sometimes is a difference of approach to an election between the candidate and the party and if you allow this statute to be held unconstitutional, you would allow the party to exercise its influence to cause the candidate to shift its views to accept those of the party.	1
1439897	Otherwise, why are we acting?	1
7433093	Why couldn't that--	1
9423013	I... I mean, only one who... who got new counsel on the direct appeal.	1
2006657	I don't think that's necessary, no, because if -- if it is a self-standing claim that is indifferent to probable cause or favorable termination or any termination, then the presumption is that the standard accrual rule would apply. But, as I --	0
9190644	--if you would.	1
6430220	Yes or no.	1
4637601	It seems to me the strongest argument against that, and I haven't heard you assert it... maybe I should have asked this question of the Solicitor General, but it seems to me the strongest argument against it is, if you do look to the underlying claim and say, has there been a substantial showing in the underlying claim that a constitutional right was denied, it seems to me then, even if the procedural ground from which appeal is immediately sought is entirely clear, even though there's not much of a doubt about the correctness of the procedural ruling, you would have to... you would have to allow appeal.	1
286035	I...  this is the...  from the one circuit that holds otherwise.	1
9598442	Excuse me. Explain that again.	1
6919016	and say...	1
9231304	The clear and unmistakable message is that religion and preparation for a career in the ministry is disfavored and discouraged.	1
943481	I would like to take just a minute on the question of the... whether a typed name can constitute a signature.	1
612017	It's very vague to me what it is you say the employee has to prove with regard to the availability or lack thereof of employer remedies.	0
6125667	Well, I I just...	1
5220055	Then what's your fall-back position?	1
3865451	I think it's all right when it seems to work the other way.	1
9561489	Now, Washington also has an anti-stacking policy, does it?	1
8756491	them.	1
7607815	What kinds of acts would be forbidden?	1
2377916	Has that been our understanding of what we'd look to?	0
9147660	All right.	1
3383438	and therefore it...	1
972802	Well, a number of courts have come to the conclusion that where the two crimes arise out of the same conduct and are closely related, that you're going to go ahead and apply the Sixth Amendment requirement to the related but yet uncharged crime.	0
8261205	--Fine.	1
1205801	What's left, if this can stand?	0
623376	I see.	1
1305332	[Laughter]	1
2619933	Everybody... you're sort of turning this on whether you have to walk to the police station or not.	1
1085357	Now, when we look at those days, we get maybe... I don't know how many days per year, but not all that many, and maybe one every 3 years or something, but let's say it's 100 days a year.	1
755659	This case has something of the same feel to it.	1
7526033	Justice...	1
3265993	Well, two answers to that, Your Honor.	1
9215530	That is what we look at, not the construction of the Central California project.	1
1932400	I would think that is a tenable view anyway, and especially in light also of the concerns about section 5.	0
7620342	It might be useful to say they were wrong in--	1
2416435	and that is --	1
2287364	our case.	1
3018353	--The... the national parties are constrained by, are constrained by Federal statute purportedly pursuing a Federal interest in, in their activities relating to a Federal, to a state and local election.	1
3657634	for me? How do you read B one to cover reverse...	1
96452	I realize.	1
1938476	May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips?	0
465784	Is that not truthful?	1
7252207	Well, it doesn't say that exactly, does it?	1
3248226	Is the effect transitory, is it nontransitory?	1
2923105	Right.	1
2364456	right.	1
26520	Mr. Moore, I think what happened in this sentencing proceeding, if I remember correctly, is that the attorney made some remarks at the beginning of the sentencing hearing?	0
282242	You said that, but is there a violation if we read it as a clear intent by Congress to have it operate just the way the State says?	0
9516924	SATP.	1
5571547	subst-	1
9190613	And all of these things would be relevant in the voluntariness inquiry, would they not?	1
2898232	A plaintiff who's part of a class in a class action suit where attorney's fees are paid.	1
1380531	What's the court going to do then, and yet here's a personal jurisdiction issue just sitting there, right there, that the court could decide.	0
1484886	Would you clarify for me why, in your petition for cert, you said that petitioner does not challenge the district court's decision to grant respondents leave to amend the complaint and to join petitioner as a new party defendant, and to do so after judgment had been rendered?	0
4842777	There's a videotape here of what happened, is there not?	1
9066846	Well, that's correct, Mr. Chief Justice, and maybe that's the point, that...  that the thousands of investors who invested in this type of scheme are the same type of thousands of investors that invest in other types of schemes.	1
8833246	Well, two things...	1
1547032	How can they do that?	1
2168149	--and to list all your automobiles and... and to show that you've--	1
5176112	And I suppose if we decide that it's wrong on the Federal section, it goes back to the Supreme Court of Iowa, they could just as easily say, well, our... our State equal protection follows Federal equal protection.	1
913209	But you said they couldn't do that on remand.	1
5575718	Well, it certainly wasn't ruling it out, Justice Scalia.	1
2840898	[Laughter]	1
1736449	The securities laws have prophylactic purposes.	1
5391511	You're not questioning that one State can sue another without an Eleventh Amendment barrier, but you say what makes it no good is that it's for the benefit of the farmers, so similarly, in the Fair Labor Standards Act, the United States is suing, but if you apply your reasoning, the workers are the same as the farmers.	1
7925178	Do you think that this Dastar product could have been copyrightable as a derivative work on its own?	1
5565420	It wouldn't be all right?	1
2040266	shows that the defendant, in fact, knew, what's the problem?	1
1533269	But we didn't apply the statute literally there.	0
2894435	when the g-	1
790688	It just strikes me as rather odd that the claimant wouldn't want to raise them.	0
9373116	Does it matter how... how much you have to take apart of a car to make a search?	1
1469436	If, in fact, the dog was written taken around the car prior to the completion of the traffic stop and the ticket, then, of course, it would be--	0
533532	Or the Tripps Treaty?	0
9397494	I say, when you get to the garden, I don't want any of those gardeners walking with their muddy boots in the house, and so here's what happens.	1
7236280	Assuming the Government never intervenes, as it has a right to do in one of these actions, would it be res judicata on the Government afterwards?	1
6637985	Here, because there's no give, it does have a punitive feel.	1
1158666	Was that said in the Kiowa case?	1
3470	Ms. Eskow, I take it all of the courts of appeals that have addressed this question have found express consent required?	0
2905609	I'm not a hundred percent sure that's true.	1
5560232	In those cases, as I recall, the public trustees were voting in their public capacity.	1
1707195	And it... it required less than putting the person in what was, in effect, a jail cell.	1
733160	And you have no problem with, in God we trust, on the coins and that sort of thing?	1
3324737	I take it your claim is based on leaching out, or some sort of damage to the soil over a period of years.	1
7835618	In other words, reasonable probability.	1
2952498	We have argued here that the, the problems with 323A, the national party prohibition is that it is an across-the-board criminal prohibition of all RNC activity.	1
347954	time that are institutional rec-	1
6800632	It...	1
9571450	All right.	1
4045489	[Laughter]	1
3383502	I mean, it's California's choice to have this scheme, and it's enacted one that does raise concerns of trying to tax extraterritorial income, in effect.	1
2533780	But is anything other than naming a person as a party that couldn't be cured after the thirty days are up, and some of the other things that you mentioned?	1
3961993	contains?	1
6741560	That isn't... that isn't somehow punitive or... or half the truth.	1
9532309	Well, it wouldn't prevent the State, would it, from coming back later and saying this crossing deserves a better mechanism and we're going to use some of the Federal money, or at least propose to use it, to upgrade?	1
1127815	is...	1
2653747	[Laughter]	1
9537299	Precisely.	1
3312781	Well, it's usually not true.	1
8760278	I don't know why you should take into account the latter, the secondary effect of this taking of water, and not take into account the former, the more immediate effect of it.	1
293471	Yes.	0
8240777	--I suppose you could answer Justice Scalia by saying that these are exceptions to the ordinary rule of finality, although the statute doesn't quite read that way.	1
1338447	Now, what's the arbitrator to do with a provision like that?	0
1956777	Could I ask about Virginia law, whether if there is newly discovered evidence that could potentially be exculpatory, that is discovered more than 21 days after the conviction, does Virginia bar any proceeding in Virginia courts to determine the fact?	0
3835334	So purely as an accounting...	1
9581968	or --	1
8763125	That's your answer to these questions.	1
1203192	Well, it was this Court's decision in the Williamson County case that led you and I assume other lawyers in these takings cases to return to State court and try to litigate everything.	1
2945479	[Laughter]	1
9514594	You had a second answer.	1
1810653	That's an 11-minute traffic stop.	0
7371358	the treat- -- One-	1
1003941	In other words, there are grounds...	0
1945929	Polidoro.	1
7215886	It's perfectly clear that eventually AEDPA will apply to all appeals.	1
9393943	The jury doesn't have to credit any particular evidence even though it believes the witness, it doesn't have to believe that that is mitigating--	1
741531	A potential...	1
2364596	Is it necessary that we go further than that?	0
6641483	So what about your...	1
4856361	person That that person...	1
5184943	work out.	1
1060748	is just...	1
4767451	Do you defend the approach taken otherwise by the courts below?	1
5398348	I mean, aren't all these terms of the contract?	1
482090	agreement...	1
3244733	would fall...	1
7716353	If... if we agreed with your view... and I'm not sure we will... about property including the right to control business assets, it does not, I assume, cover some personal right of somebody to obtain services in the clinic.	1
6641165	I would say it has to be exclusive reference under the Siebold regime, Your Honor.	1
4078457	Has it had some effect there--	1
1049513	They were not...  they were not...  some of them were variable returns, Mr. Chief Justice, but some of them were fixed return.	1
5889470	We...	1
32231	Isolated, intrastate pond?	0
622396	Well, but in common sense terms, under your theory you are taking coal.	1
6438131	That's circular.	1
836857	I thought maybe you'd enlighten me there.	0
8686136	very few cases...	1
779318	what we'll...	1
7702615	on for Federal tax pur-	1
5876356	[Laughter]	1
9414867	The three examples you came up with, their response to that is, each of them involves, if you're right, the Government collecting less money, and we don't care.	1
2709904	I- okay...	1
2128565	So why is that such, what is, particularly, and I wanted to you to get to this, if the disclosure regulations, the new ones, the new provisions in the law on independent expenditure--	1
3514231	after the comment because...	1
2040163	So why would you complain about 3 o'clock?	1
570255	existing here.	1
1985573	of the more -- Okay.	1
8805368	But aren't you picking one of the two means of finality that's set forth in the earlier provision?	1
1793085	The waiter...	0
426114	What what if the defense counsel presented nothing at all at the sentencing phase, do you think that there is potential for application of Cronic in those circumstances?	1
4595852	--But is there... there's no final judgment there, is there, on the attorney's fees?	1
5594751	surprising...	1
5926058	We have argued here that the, the problems with 323A, the national party prohibition is that it is an across-the-board criminal prohibition of all RNC activity.	1
5920756	Well I thought that this was that circumstance of benefits.	1
891829	The attorney would...  if the client wanted to appeal, and the attorney felt the grounds were frivolous, the attorney does not have an obligation to file the appeal, although the attorney would assist the defendant in filing his own appeal.	0
8501234	--Well, you would... you would concede that it is least ambiguous because the legislature said our purpose is regulatory.	1
1937275	Why should this?	0
7811687	It would seem to me a very strange way to do it, to conflate the definition of gas and coal.	1
7941817	And you think...	1
1280196	It seems to me that if we say... if you're talking about Federal equal protection, this is an area in which the leeway for the legislature is the widest that there is.	1
366161	So how was that appropriation money in fact used by the Federal Government, do you say?	0
5483216	argument, Justice O'Connor. Yes. The statutory language definitely does require...	1
316211	Ms. O'Connor?	1
641519	What if--	0
5582185	under under manual tasks?	1
1100860	Well, do you take the... why don't you simplify it by telling us whether you take the position today that there is or is not a liberty interest here?	1
2187019	I would have thought that went rather to the heart of the sentencing question.	0
4088449	And now it physically occupies 4 of the 35.	1
4979953	in looking at the manual task approach, how how is the fact finder supposed to decide which manual tasks are sufficiently important to constitute a substantial limitation? I mean, how do you weigh that? H- how do we decide it? Is there any guidance on that?	1
995472	But if you have a reasonable analysis--	0
8588889	That's how they qualified under ERISA.	1
2497424	--I just thought there was no final judgment as to the attorney's fees.	1
354107	Not necessarily, Your Honor, and it is incumbent upon any taxpayer upon whom a tax is imposed to maintain whatever books and records...	0
1059543	That's right, Your Honor.	0
2618638	s- s-	1
1545010	[Laughter]	1
799021	non ver-	1
9018772	There's nothing false in the information reported.	1
1366864	Well, the dog sniff itself, I think, is a matter of seconds.	0
7662856	Is that your position?	1
8085796	prac-	1
336894	person is, and what are they going --	1
6532761	fairness...	1
2068080	Now, why is it, I just have been a little puzzled about the case, this was proved with respect to both the 1st and the 12th Districts.	1
4907636	That seems like tilting the securities laws completely on their head.	1
744245	that they weren't...	1
1500157	Clearly it has to be made.	0
5527303	It's... it's hard to say because there's no hard scientific data, and I--	1
3270754	true? Is that what having a foundation means?	1
3046131	talking about...	1
8103550	Now, have I read the newspapers wrong or is that possibly practice in respect to some political candidates?	1
6190269	[Laughter]	1
5832194	Yeah, but active inducement is a doctrine that's been employed to curb the intentional encouragement of noninfringing uses, isn't it?	1
3029254	I mean, that's the way you're articulating the test.	1
649138	I mean, it's very confusing.	0
1651294	Is there any reason why we should address it, since it came so late in the day?	1
7390941	Well, there's one difference between the situation that would obtain then and the situation that... that you're objecting to here.	1
2015829	Uh-huh...	1
4942005	But I don't see how it, just and reasonable rates.	1
3548951	This methane comes up, they take the methane, but it--	1
7310527	So in your view the principal would be quite unconstrained by the Constitution from voting to deny membership to a school because its athletes were black, or Catholic, or something like that?	1
9615195	What's the purpose of emphasizing that?	1
6893339	case.	1
4862046	[Laughter]	1
9323001	The allocation regulations allowed the RNC to spend whatever it could raise and whatever it wanted to spend subject to state law.	1
6704246	Yes.	1
7219660	For --	1
1958608	If the methane comes out in drilling, as in gaseous form, and I'm a chemistry student, is the formula for the methane gas the same as the formula for, say, hard anthracite coal?	1
269652	Sure, so my question is, if the authorization in the statute is a key to a determination that there is State action here, wouldn't the general law of contract be an equal key, even if this provision did not exist?	1
8742001	Yes, Justice Breyer.	1
142278	So, that's the end of this case.	1
4691954	Mr. Sutton, may I tell you why I at least am concerned about your saying this is like any other commodity, but it really isn't.	1
7301821	But why?	1
2378374	Okay.	1
1944036	the Government did...	1
7527560	Now, is there a basis for distinguishing that and if so, what, and why?	1
2057845	Are you talking about the Fifth or the Ninth?	1
6881235	Now, if that phrase were entirely omitted from the statute, would it make any difference in your view?	1
3191309	You're talking about both kinds of... you're talking about gas in both those aspects, is that correct?	1
794575	But--	1
2112729	Well, did he have as much of a right as a fellow passenger would have--	0
1841233	Mr. Haberbush, would you be able, after the argument, to furnish the Court with the places in the record available to us where it shows that you raised the State statute of limitations issue below?	0
2189234	But in a in a situation where the employer's policy is just to create open positions every quarter, that aren't enforceable anyway on behalf of any employee, is it unreasonable to say the employer has to accommodate this disabled worker?	0
156303	Do you think it's a problem for a legislature to say robbery is punishable by anything from a year to life?	0
3183817	In other words, if every--	1
5744321	eight USC eleven...	1
1177618	But I do think that just because a dog sniff prolongs the traffic stop by some, you know, incremental amount of time doesn't mean that the stop is per se unreasonable.	0
2153393	--Have you responded to my initial question?	0
7955078	I mean, how... how many times within that 20 to 40 percent category do we get into an argument later on as to whether 2255 can be availed of because, in fact, a... a record was sufficiently developed to... to raise the... the claim on direct?	1
1567803	Justice Breyer was much better than I said it.	0
1471650	Well, now you're building in something that I didn't ask.	0
8891883	--Certainly somebody bringing a 200-year-old claim would find a formidable barrier in the doctrine of laches, would they not?	1
8504866	I mean, the determination--	1
3985884	magically, since its concession in the district court, at the appellate level and again in its briefs before this Court, the respondent has come up with all sorts of ideas that might challenge the amount of the assessment.	1
2507159	Are you disputing those figures or not?	1
116420	Mr. Waide, is it... is it your position that a plaintiff is always entitled to get to the jury in a case like this if he establishes that the employer's stated, articulated reason for the employment action is false?	1
1008031	This is the first time I've understood that.	1
5672106	If people in power want to draft the lines to keep themselves in power, that's perfectly okay with you?	1
766423	practice?	1
2043580	What about the heterosexual Scout leader who openly espouses the view that homosexuality is consistent with Scout law and oath, and that it's not immoral?	1
3773754	percent of the population.	1
3209583	Well, would you say that a ship coming in at a port in our country from elsewhere cannot be searched thoroughly without reasonable suspicion?	1
5172830	Well, Mr. Blume, I wondered if the language directs us to some kind of an exhaustion requirement, trying to make sure that State... people convicted in State proceedings try to raise their claims first in State court and get the facts developed.	1
6197710	So the old law was thought to have no application to implicit statements.	1
4919564	person is, and what are they going --	1
7952727	I don't think so.	1
318645	Would it violate the Equal Protection Clause?	1
8860236	acknowledge at least that it's virtually impossible for the taxpayer to get that information? I mean, the taxpayer has the reports from the employees,	1
260959	This case is jusst...	1
7538974	Yes.	1
2958648	But, General Olson, there's a... a difference in those... those restrictions that affect one part of one's life.	1
5838558	Is there an ex post facto violation there?	1
5326624	If this Court approaches matters that way, then in effect we're going to have two different methodologies, one for Federal cases, I guess, and... and one for... for State cases.	1
8250394	Now, are there ways... are there regulatory ways that Congress could have gone in more closely or more narrowly and limited the ability of national parties to spend money coming out of those non-Federal accounts, those 12 non-Federal accounts?	1
422320	No duty to advise.	0
3917700	That is what we look at, not the construction of the Central California project.	1
6343257	I... I would have thought that broad statement was not accurate in light of Chalker, that it doesn't have to be facially discriminatory to be covered.	1
19725	Was it basically like it is today, or has it gotten worse?	0
3305050	The official capacity suits have been dropped.	1
4811354	I want to make sure we're together at least on one point.	1
94104	We had not taken as broad a view of the Commerce Clause power as is true today, is that correct?	1
8045298	I mean, what do you lose at the end of the day?	1
1408033	Well, Your Honor, that's not an arguable issue, because the defendant was advised on the record at the plea hearing that he would receive a sentence of 15 years to life.	0
443983	--The formal test no, your Honor, that would not be the case at all.	0
2437535	yeah but any   DSM --	1
78041	Are we just talking pure hypotheticals here?	0
4999065	But I did have a question direct--	1
2374851	You mean even the speaker or the person taking the statement.	1
4233181	--And maybe that--	1
9052254	Your Honor.	1
3168471	Well, that then...	1
8169340	It covers any funds that the party has, so it is prophylactic.	1
1039998	Total impairment?	0
1051411	And so, I think the question is, Should we follow the majority of the Circuits?	1
6787493	dispersal of business...	1
2821192	You told me the school can do that.	1
4660778	The instruction that's set forth on page 5 was read to them in voir dire?	1
8234240	[Laughter]	1
1592398	Is that a problem?	0
1843861	Yes, Congress has done nothing about this, has it?	0
2707164	And I'm not sure that I understand, under your test, how that fourth prong would be applied or if it's still part of the test.	1
6633264	And yet, what you have just said again would indicate that's not a consideration in setting the standards.	1
6433887	would result in...	1
1719799	In this case, the stated reason I think we assume, at least according to the trial judge's instruction to the jury, was unlawful.	0
6850942	I mean, usually these things are done for the self-interest of... of legislators from various districts, and... and as long as there could be a rational... I... I would have... I'm surprised it took you so long to answer that question.	1
8500970	That certainly isn't this case.	1
598673	Mr. Porter, I don't think that on its face it says that.	1
742955	Yes, Your Honor.	0
6996791	contingency...	1
5074273	Can I...	1
5722064	Well, presumably the person filling the gas tank with drugs had to disassemble the tank to put the drugs in there, so apparently willing to take that risk--	1
8345758	You didn't file it in writing.	1
4959580	Do you call witnesses?	1
408503	It's not known in the other case that a judge determined this... this person had been cured to the extent that he could have the custody of a... a minor child.	1
1311479	Well, I do take issue with that.	1
7999011	So were... were... was testimony taken from legislators asking why did you vote for this bill?	1
2220108	I guess this thing went to the jury under an instruction that tried to come to grips with the definition under the statute in some way.	0
2064395	He stands up and says on the record, Your Honor, I wish the record to show I've been asleep for an hour during the key cross examination.	1
8934069	But as far as punitive intent is concerned, that's not the legislature's--	1
556274	You had a second answer.	1
6904300	I suppose you wouldn't have to go along with all of those things, but I am interested to know whether you think there is a baseline requirement that the court advise the defendant in making a plea that he has a right to counsel and the attorney could be helpful in making that decision.	1
9214016	[Laughter]	1
3871006	But, in Morrison, did the Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify Commerce Cause... Clause legislation by using a long but-for causal chain from the activity in question to an impact on interstate commerce?	1
1944009	tips that they may have...	1
3530608	[Laughter]	1
404737	And you don't concede it.	0
2930919	In... in the criminal system, are statute of limitations routinely held waived?	1
4690226	If that's your point, then how do you respond to their argument which is that that's just too tough to do?	1
7759064	of your spouse.	1
5384879	So suppose you don't sign it?	1
4072967	What sort of an extraordinary writ would you envision, Mr. Sarnowski?	1
73824	And the thing that's striking about this procedure is that now you have the two parties to the settlement agreement, the United States and the tribe, coming in and telling us the same story, which is it isn't what you say it is.	0
7253000	They're not in that footnote.	1
4629610	Well, do you take the... why don't you simplify it by telling us whether you take the position today that there is or is not a liberty interest here?	1
7662747	I take it your claim is based on leaching out, or some sort of damage to the soil over a period of years.	1
655414	If they had a policy of not prosecuting minimal amounts of possession of marijuana, then I take it, it would or would not be reasonable to go in?	1
4209039	I don't see how anything you said with regard to his dangerousness would affect the jury's determination regarding how culpable he was.	1
2112405	And one question as to whether it's preempted, I would think, would be can they go back to the Federal ratemaker and... and, in fact, get the relief that they want.	1
8478689	I mean the statute itself refers to that as a cap.	1
8881140	you cited...	1
7415710	Thank you, Mr. McCormick.	1
3201723	Could you do that?	1
5141108	So you don't really support the Ninth Circuit test.	1
6009373	--Mr. Sutton, I understand you were prepared to acknowledge that the State could ban ads that say, smoking ain't so bad, it's worth it.	1
4267834	--where... where Dow just says the federally mandated statement is included on my label and it's true?	1
3338676	It addresses --	1
4115716	Why don't you focus on the statement and tell us why it would or would not be different?	1
9229513	We're talking about the initial --	1
5746482	But there was none for you at the time?	1
2120030	I mean that's such an odd posture in a sense it's very awkward to say the least.	1
7895395	Hm?	1
1858420	So you read our precedents as saying our inquiry must be simply confined to a facial inquiry, and not to the reality of what the treatment is or is going to be?	1
5134716	Did you file anything in State court after this particular notice?	1
5413103	All right.	1
6972089	I think if it's...	1
1829622	But I thought, and maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought it directed that certain votes that had been tabulated after the expiration of the original certification date were to be included now without reference to the point at all that their opinion had been vacated.	0
5430477	Generally speaking, what percentage of the raw milk comes in from out of State to California, of the total?	1
590154	If I...	1
1917354	And it's also worth noting here that the allocation regulations that the senatorial or congressional committees operate under are governed by the actual amounts spent on state and local activity, subject to a percentage of a 60 percent cap.	1
1719283	That the employer had no remedial scheme in place or what is it?	0
2096835	At the end of the day, what happened?	0
8590136	It's a strange...	1
4594539	But you agree that it's... that it's not jurisdictional with regard to... to an attorney?	1
3215746	Well, what--	1
1377622	Yes.	0
4873007	Becaus-	1
388448	Now, those are very specific and with time deadlines required apparently by rules of the BLM?	0
5988875	Is the effects test used to impeach the finding that the legislature had a regulatory intent?	1
6838554	Can you articulate the rule that you want?	1
4375846	Well, do you agree with that?	1
9173735	That is, full-time employee--	1
7726058	Would it make any difference in your analysis... I don't know if this is true or not... but if the legislative history, if you had a complete record of all the debates and everything else, and it was perfectly clear that the hypothetical reasons you advance were definitely not the reasons that motivated the particular tax rates, that they did it just, say, to get even with the racetracks because somebody was unhappy with something they had done in the past or something like that, would that make any difference?	1
3068396	and in fact, he...	1
2155426	So how does this work?	1
8192260	long...	1
919324	Indeed, that I'm wrong, or indeed, it is?	0
6597890	All right.	1
803872	But I'm asking you about the people in this large category who are still dangerous, or at least have made no showing that they are not dangerous.	1
9152736	You have year-by-year employment.	1
454511	et cetera.	1
8405458	Yes, but... against its consent.	1
7316711	is that your...	1
806278	That's how I would read it, too.	1
453446	Well, I think -- I think -- I think it--	0
8604098	of incarceration.	1
6636609	pre-existing moral or legal -- Mhm.	1
6320831	What we think is...	1
9668563	to obtain punitive damages.	1
6698129	Isn't that what we're talking about here?	1
2576041	It is a boundless proposition that leaves the states no room to legislate on their own elections because they contend... you're exactly right.	1
287258	Do we send it back...	0
1602053	All right.	1
3923477	And what's your position after 1985?	1
6627275	So they can use that shape and color, presumably.	1
43959	But now the State enters into that exact same contract.	1
1134994	Could the State ban adults from receiving advertising of that sort?	1
430571	And to the extent that you then allow the other courts of appeals to deal with patent claims, you're defeating that uniformity goal.	0
3627000	I think--	1
2407725	I didn't know that's what we had done.	1
8093828	--pursuing administrative claims adjudication?	1
329104	Well, what financial interests do your clients have to keep litigating today in another court?	0
2671285	going...	1
2007938	There's a five to five split below, and the Sentencing Commission is considering a change, particularly hard for us to deal with.	0
9179565	Treasury regs adopted by... how, notice and comment rulemaking?	1
1516545	I'm sorry, I knew that, but I may have read the newspapers with a cynical eye, but it seems what I read in the papers says that some candidates, anyway, write letters to their friends and say, now, write checks for X to me personally, then you max out.	1
456083	--And I thought that, at least, would be open on remand.	0
1541869	that there's a consensus and want to argue it's just not enduring? Or what is it you're...	1
6012976	The early statutes?	1
2401512	[Laughter]	1
1923337	I mean, the... the jury was reminded that arguments of counsel are just that.	0
462024	Well, what if the arresting officer just doesn't give a reason for the arrest, just makes the arrest, and it turns out, at the end of the day, that indeed there were objective facts that would have justified an arrest.	1
8084408	Well, of course, that just restates the proposition of what the law is and brings us right back to where we started.	1
9658214	And not as a so-called interlocking... well, it was an interlocking--	1
8318033	But the Ninth Circuit thought that went beyond the clear terms of the statute.	1
7927292	Now, if they applied that to people who were convicted after they passed it, would that be ex post facto?	1
8073464	concealed cargo...	1
4375249	And is it... is it in the material before us?	1
2976443	dispersal of business...	1
6888065	Now, if... if this didn't involve the alternative minimum tax, would the amount be deductible?	1
381454	If you are correct that Section 502(a) preempts, is it possible that under ERISA 502(a)(3), that the plaintiffs might recover some money, for example, for pain and suffering and things like that?	0
3946058	But often it hinges, when you're talking about immunity it hinges upon factual determinations that can only be found later.	1
1665193	No.	1
7210607	No...	1
4887363	--(i)--	1
6717016	And those rights...	1
777342	Well, Your Honor, actually his argument is that he thought he was going to get 3-1/2 years, and there is simply no support for that.	0
635137	Part of your allegation could seem to establish that, if this particular facility is... has no psychiatrist and is in a correction facility, everybody incarcerated there must be punished, I would think.	1
8212457	--What about a house and... and the use of a dog to sniff around a door access or a house just because the police think, you know, it's possible this is somebody growing marijuana in the basement or something?	1
1413412	When the mission is complete--	0
1916998	But had the Court ever said that the Free Exercise Clause couldn't be applied in the prison context?	1
1365480	Well, In- Indeed.	0
244159	No.	0
3273943	I...	1
2095952	--on the legal incidence of the tax, we suggested, in the Chickasaw Nation case, that a tax statute's own declaration of the legal incidence would be dispositive.	1
2623971	come from, first of all.	1
2959034	here's the thing.	1
3030873	reasonable...	1
7285567	No and I'm not...	1
195577	Well, Strickland...  Strickland says we're going to approach it on a case-by-case basis.	1
9140748	Are there... a fairly small number, I would assume?	1
2775155	Because, I've listened to a lot of vague language.	1
4180204	Thank you, Mr. Me- Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.	1
324612	Well, that's the question.	1
637698	Well, now you're building in something that I didn't ask.	0
6888924	citizens...	1
1961360	This is punitive.	1
2134791	--In our cases, is there any difference between Congress' prohibiting something under its section 5 power and creating a substantive entitlement under that power?	0
6406189	It wouldn't even mesh with Anders.	1
8033867	Section 323(a) the national party prohibition is a restriction regardless of whether the amounts are coordinated or uncoordinated, a principle from the Buckley cases.	1
3133115	59a?	1
2076667	What's the situation?	1
3910440	And do the statistics also tell us how often under a Wende procedure the courts would actually find arguable issues on their review and send it back?	1
5766235	But I thought that's what you wanted to ignore?	1
6755185	In other words, don't want to make them mad.	1
3595584	The state denied that, did it not?	1
4192285	Well, but under your view, any late pay is wrongful, if it was due.	1
9424308	--Congress wanted to, so it's opposite Chevron.	1
3792061	With respect to...	1
2179894	How...  how many states have similar provisions in their constitutions or laws?	0
2907809	If the person wants to take a program in theology, he's disqualified.	1
6861555	And if we look at coughing outdoor children we see with.09 in the air, approximately.9 of 1 percent of all the coughing outdoor children will cough and it will hurt.	1
5805972	And that's the scheme Congress has authorized, and they are served by doctors that have ethical obligations in the treatment of patients, and I suppose Congress relied on the ability of the enforcement of those ethical obligations to curb what otherwise might appear to be an unfortunate financial incentive to cut costs, and I... why should the courts get involved in this messy business of deciding what scheme is an undue infringement and what isn't?	1
2394726	In fact, we think they'd be remiss if they did.	0
66733	It appears at page fifty-five A of the appendix to our petition.	0
3116	Is that your position?	1
5200259	General Underwood, in the few minutes remaining, do you think you could give us a 1-minute explanation of your views about the First Amendment issues?	1
9434640	Very well, Mr. Sutton.	1
337875	Yes.	1
399432	What other what other ones are there, is is is what what other retrospective sanctions are there?	1
7054393	No, but you're talking about the money as though the money were particular dollar bills, and the subcontractor has a right to particular dollar bills that the prime gets from the State.	1
1887356	Has that been our understanding of what we'd look to?	0
6085463	But what what is it with regard to the prior offenses, if you will, that have for which grievance procedures have been filed? How is that then addressed?	1
268892	Right.	1
2889766	This report that you're now describing was a report made to Congress by--	1
1680676	I mean, that seems rather routine.	0
1009984	I I don't know, it just struck me in reading the question that it was pretty much limited to whether they were right about whether you could rely on the Hart decision.	0
6454468	Tell us, though, what it is in that sentence of yours that makes it meet the nondelegation standards, whereas the present provision does not, as interpreted by CASAC?	1
1153331	Yes, but the problem here is, California has chosen to allocate 100 percent of the taxpayer's interest expense in excess of its business interest income to its generation of nonbusiness income that's not taxable by California.	1
6719847	When they agree that in effect they will be subject to a court, having that subject matter jurisdiction, and when they agree that they are subject to any court having that subject matter jurisdiction, isn't that a pretty clear waiver and doesn't it go beyond certainly merely an agreement to arbitrate?	1
8760966	Which was identical to the first.	1
4978805	They're at a disadvantage to that extent.	1
1697772	In other words...	0
2585617	I find that not a valid defense.	1
814321	And do you think people in general thought that the APA was just setting up some kind of minimum standards here, and--	0
5617748	And you say the Secretary has exercised it just by providing the funds, whether or not any particular review is made?	1
7587322	The language about what they have to do to answer no, that at least ten jurors have to have a reasonable doubt as to the facts?	1
1675611	Mr. Miller... General Miller, you have four--	1
7475951	--And what's the... what's the answer with respect to a State pardon?	1
6526133	They were not...  they were not...  some of them were variable returns, Mr. Chief Justice, but some of them were fixed return.	1
665290	Now, could the school district say we are not going to allow access to any groups in off school hours?	0
5757527	Absolutely not.	1
987623	Well, I mean, if he has arguable grounds for an appeal, then there would be a duty to advise of appeal rights, but...	0
2264051	May I--	0
5497597	It isn't clear to me.	1
2472078	of the board?	1
8813372	twenty-one...	1
3519867	They didn't have to give you anything.	1
6677108	To to justify in court. Right.	1
8019884	doesn't matter, which you have --	1
4347892	[Laughter]	1
1969451	That is something that the -- that the courts are looking at as to whether that is something that you should be able to do.	0
6397012	If you drew the line at when the work is performed, that's a different question it seems to me.	1
7733387	That's right, and what Lindh involved was the substantive requirements for habeas, and it said this would be retroactive if you applied the new substantive requirements to a case already filed.	1
7626312	What other what other ones are there, is is is what what other retrospective sanctions are there?	1
27331	And what standard do we apply, then?	0
1990231	In other words, you want to support a per se rule no matter what.	0
3699207	What is it that imposes the limit on the Tribal Court's jurisdiction?	1
5651985	Preclusion.	1
2643731	Which one of the four Colorado exceptions raises that in your judgment?	1
1577557	Yeah.	1
2541577	They could only do that under the Fourteenth Amendment.	1
8809399	Well, is there a...  but you take the position that it would be proper in every case.	1
6123331	conspiracy...	1
7587027	that in fact --	1
955303	Does the general policy that underlies their doctrine of stare decisis have any bearing on what we should do with this case, do you think?	1
7895260	What in that case, what statute were we interpreting?	1
6078655	Now, is...	1
1268437	Mr. Coleman, you seem to be arguing something contrary to what Mr. Phillips argued.	0
1939150	under...	1
2936593	criminal law.	1
9259791	Well, what do the annual...	1
2299479	Let's put it that way.	0
160705	--And presumably, states can regulate, under your theory, these isolated waters that don't flow into navigable waters.	0
7060854	versus Safley analysis. It's not...	1
3096609	who had not been convicted of crimes and who had not been placed on probation.	1
1860183	That's what we're reviewing.	0
2117841	They're taxed differently.	1
3545973	But why?	1
7435238	Well, the Federal Government didn't adopt your position until very recently, until this thing became valuable, and until then the Federal Government took the position urged by Mr. Phillips.	1
2200003	do do you know of any?	1
436406	--Yes, but what I'm saying to you is I would think a line could be drawn saying it depends on when the work was performed, and if it was performed after the effective date, the statute applies.	0
4920	--Well, I think there are two ways to understand the language in the two cases you're referring to in Caballas.	0
7616226	--Well, how... how about a wire tap?	1
6024326	[Laughter]	1
1678385	answer the question, though, and I have the same problem Justice Breyer does.	1
1373423	What do you think the proper measure of damages should be?	1
4171983	it were.	1
2226659	I'm asking you, is my example preempted, in your opinion?	1
8558997	[Laughter]	1
2024596	--in this case.	0
750456	Well, is there some burden on the part of the prosecutor and the court to consider at least alternative restraints or measures to make sure that there's no misbehavior?	0
555624	Well, I... I thought there was language in the Ray opinion that title II has twin goals of providing for vessel safety and protecting the marine environment.	0
8106586	Well, if they said they don't want to do it, then why are you arguing to the contrary?	1
7873130	1729.	1
2830833	You do not apply the new requirements to all cases that were already filed.	1
6911513	And you're saying that Congress in the Federal Power Act set up an act where you have a single central Federal body to provide tariffs for, let's say, the billions and billions of kilowatt hours made every year, but that each State... 50 or 51 different local service commissions are going to adjudicate whether or not those millions of words are, in fact, violated and what we will have is 51 separate decisionmaking bodies to determine when a FERC tariff has been violated.	1
696069	But presumably for the hotels that are not on fee land, at least, they are not... the guests are not paying a state tax or a county tax.	1
9487622	What page?	1
1458483	So there could be a trade dress in an expired patented item.	0
332713	Mr. Robinson, what has the practice been in the various circuits under this statute?	0
6728473	Which?	1
2971982	Why don't you simply say that all that Lindh held was that the substantive requirements are governed by a nonretroactive principle, and what nonretroactivity means for the substantive requirements is that you apply them to all cases.	1
8466196	Well, what if the final action, the decision to terminate the services of the employee what if it had been based on the commission of some prior failure as an employee and the grievance procedure had proceeded and it had been determined that it was invalid?	1
7045893	--Well, it was an option--	1
5056245	I have some difficulty in adopting a test that this is an irrigation facility.	1
1916109	If we disagree with you, to the extent we think some application of the district's fleet rules are not preempted, then how does that leave your challenge, which is a facial one?	0
431781	Well, do you... do you... understood in order to win under an equal protection argument, do you have to apply some sort of heightened scrutiny?	0
3341394	custody.	1
687473	So if that's right... I... I mean, you're not... I don't think you can show the first.	1
2493511	Mr. Wright, you're not arguing that the Constitution requires one approach or another, are you?	1
2779585	That... Justice Breyer, it's correct that it saves time at the stage of collateral review, but the question for procedural default purposes is the effect of the rule at the time of direct appeal, and--	1
7143921	Then the argument is that Congress has reserved something and it shouldn't have reserved it.	1
1553804	Is that part of -- of the mission?	0
9473902	think that the practice around the country of various towns and cities is to require permits for people to go door to door in residential areas? I think I even live in a community that probably does that.	1
9341785	Why?	1
1491954	Does it... does the statute require the prison officials to evaluate the bona fides of the particular religion that's espoused?	0
791389	Well, yes, Your Honor, if the issue of sentencing is left completely open...	0
2129627	And you're talking now about post eligibility?	0
1784566	You say not precisely, you would not have any problem with saying that there's a taking if you have a set back requirement of 900 yards on a lot that is 901 yards wide.	1
7707011	Yes.	1
1573599	Yes.	0
5251101	Yes, Your Honor...	1
1191496	Whether he hands the ticket to him at that point in time, if the only reason--	0
6262317	Part of your allegation could seem to establish that, if this particular facility is... has no psychiatrist and is in a correction facility, everybody incarcerated there must be punished, I would think.	1
262527	So some of the lower courts have given a broad interpretation to Rooker-Feldman and have turned it into something other than the narrower view of it.	1
5888996	defendants who believe that kind of thing.	1
6498744	It does say the broader thing on its face, but I'm especially struck by the fact that this language amended an earlier text which did say exactly what you say this new text says.	1
996589	And in the normal...	1
3731336	Well, the characteristics are...	1
1321513	Thank you, Mr. Thompson.	1
6876556	Now, you say that's just shorthand for those portions of Greensboro that were reliably Democratic.	1
3311341	No, you're just allowing it to say that the rules that the association imposes on its members are a State action.	1
5598252	period during which he could not work.	1
3324358	I mean, I think that's what we need to look at.	1
313091	then the statute would not apply?	1
7939782	--The... the national--	1
325332	district court or...	1
183903	Then can they go... start over again and go down to the trial court and the court of appeals?	0
987758	Would you explain to me...	1
531096	Mr. Moore, I think what happened in this sentencing proceeding, if I remember correctly, is that the attorney made some remarks at the beginning of the sentencing hearing?	0
6532199	But in your view in looking at the standards governing EPA's setting of these national ambient air quality standards, you think that the EPA may not consider any of these economic or cost factors--	1
5294780	No, but please come back to my question.	1
911373	the brief of the...	1
8301649	Kansas.	1
844805	But I thought that's what you wanted to ignore?	1
8975035	Your answer is yes.	1
2015413	That's, I think, what I take it is their main claim on the nondelegation point and so I would like to you respond to that directly.	1
1813721	--That's right, broader.	1
9470618	--Have they given up on the second one?	1
1786151	--open to the Federal Courts.	1
5751024	Now, that it seems to me is what the government's argument boils down to, and they're saying we never know about these corruption things or the appearance, but the difference between fifty families and a thousand families is as good as any.	1
1180736	Was this complaint...	1
1514974	Does the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause apply to a Government tax scheme that taxes something beyond the income received?	1
9440550	Well, do you have other means to get the information?	1
4041023	Mm-hum.	1
4934472	So it's... it's hard to say what the sort of cost to the system, if there is one, would be of going one way or the other?	1
6076662	So the Levin Amendment is not--	1
3518415	[Laughter]	1
4809155	it's I I think...	1
7229882	So whether or not it's flood water depends on where it ultimately comes out?	1
7633215	Is that an issue before us?	1
8527530	Your Honor- I'm sorry.	1
5446646	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
9140463	it were.	1
137294	so forth. Those...	1
1349145	You can charge...	0
1665208	The GFF, which you say is analogous to a forum, and then the...  the student referendum mechanism, and what's the third?	0
7877705	I'm sorry, I knew that, but I may have read the newspapers with a cynical eye, but it seems what I read in the papers says that some candidates, anyway, write letters to their friends and say, now, write checks for X to me personally, then you max out.	1
5679582	let me point out a couple of things from your question, Justice Souter.	1
5321562	Mr. Feldman, you have 4 minutes remaining.	1
1325620	We...	1
3569130	Roberts had a reason and the reason that Roberts gave why it was intolerable was that the jury was just invited on no evidence whatever to move the offense downward which would have been the exact thing that Furman objected to.	1
4683407	court and ask for relief.	1
2471640	What if we assume that the subcontractor did not violate the law, everything was fine, the State was just in error.	1
8260011	Don't you...	1
4472672	same location?	1
1395546	There were three named indigents.	0
3155444	Okay, but they're not... I mean, this is a preliminary pleading issue, so they're not in the record of this case, and we'd better... I suppose we had better be sure of that before we come up with a rule that requires apportionment.	1
8408039	You see why I kept thinking it was different?	1
8204632	It remains...	1
4145696	Even though--	1
3801896	Which was identical to the first.	1
4397012	Subsection B --	1
8366563	That they say the words, this agreement shall be specifically enforceable in any court having jurisdiction means in any Tribal Court having jurisdiction, and why doesn't it mean that?	1
429790	Do you think that it's possible that in some instances it is a valid strategy to focus on the punishment/sentencing phase rather than the guilt phase if the lawyer has reviewed all the evidence and it appears to the lawyer to be overwhelming?	0
9466895	But you said something in your reply brief that... that really surprised me.	1
4014688	[Laughter]	1
2540111	I was just struck by how strange it was, really, to try to measure damages here in dollars based on some estimated crop loss to individual farmers.	1
3018306	That money is not subject to the allocation regulations.	1
4605080	The statutory exemption.	1
1793889	Jurisdiction under Habeas Statute?	0
2906862	when service is to...	1
1733798	Was a FOIA claim open to the respondent here? Could could such information have been sought and obtained theoretically under FOIA?	0
3692581	Didn't the Ninth Circuit found... find there was no intent to make it punitive, but looked to the effects?	1
5661152	There are four circuits that have held that there is no preemption of that.	1
581661	Well, but that's--	0
9111330	--Well, again, that's... that's not... that's really not clear.	1
5798131	Well, that is certainly a rationale that supports spending limits generally, but I don't know that it is, it is or was meant to be the exhaustive rationale for a distinction between coordinated and uncoordinated because if that were the only issue there wouldn't have been any distinction.	1
7141488	beginning with the first...	1
6406125	I'm just awed that you would think you would pick your best cases to give to supply the missing link in the experts' testimony, and yet the ones that you pick as your presumably best cases all make this district even odder shape than it's ever been.	1
9375501	We have to focus on the immunity statute that was passed in the wake of that 1927 massive flood of the Mississippi River.	1
2725200	I mean, it's very peculiar and I'd like you to speak to that for a minute, if you would.	1
31865	That... Justice Breyer, it's correct that it saves time at the stage of collateral review, but the question for procedural default purposes is the effect of the rule at the time of direct appeal, and--	1
3559757	Very well Mr. Smith.	1
3838450	Thank you, Mr. Bell.	1
1335791	--on which we granted cert?	0
7527959	No, I don't either.	1
8398335	[Laughter]	1
1658390	Yes.	0
6904131	also...	1
3055546	What is your...	1
7154336	I think what we said is that the mental incapacity has to be one of the factors the jury is allowed to take into account and I think it's a perfectly reasonable way for the judge to say find no to one of the Texas special issues in the statute, if that's... if that's what you... what you think is the case.	1
4146353	Thank you, General Underwood.	1
1844341	The definition of utility...	0
5856205	If the discrete situation applies in the accident, why shouldn't the discrete situation, in effect, rule apply here if they can show by the records kept by the dam that except in, let's say, five instances in which the canal was used for overflow for flood control purposes, all the other water that was diverted into that canal was for nonflood-control purposes and therefore you would get your immunity on some apportionment theory?	1
6537349	Do we have to find that the strike of at least one African American prospective juror was race-based for you to prevail?	1
6376883	Well, this is where... I mean, exact... I enter into a contract to have my house built, but the prime is going to have subs.	1
7630662	Mr. Bell, a lawyer...	1
7364881	Mr. Seideman, we'll hear from you.	1
6783288	Right.	1
9142117	And the first time the SEC sought to enforce an investment contract in this kind of context is SEC v. Universal Services, which goes back to 1936.	1
93171	But why isn't this just a regulation of a particularly virulent form of intimidation?	0
1595363	[Laughter]	1
9282148	All right.	1
480425	Could I ask about Virginia law, whether if there is newly discovered evidence that could potentially be exculpatory, that is discovered more than 21 days after the conviction, does Virginia bar any proceeding in Virginia courts to determine the fact?	0
8339039	We manage the risk at stage 2, at the implementation stage.	1
8834033	Excuse me,	1
2240401	And regardless, I mean, he was -- see, here's the -- here's the -- what we do know about this case: Not only do we know the mission is done because of the tasks that were completed, you have the officer that says, I've done the tasks, everything that needs to be done with this offense or with this -- with this traffic stop is finished.	0
284543	Has the State paid all the fees to the attorneys for monitoring up to the effective date of the PLRA?	0
9520343	[Inaudible]	1
7125391	But if you're right about Buffalo Creek, it would mean that the effect of the government's decision to repossess something in Kansas was to leave the Oneidas without any land.	1
5760701	Are you saying... I want to be sure I understand your argument... that although the terms, requisite to public... protect the public health are too vague and too standardless, it would be all right if it said, are requisite to protect the public health provided it doesn't cost too much?	1
8198968	Mr. Schaerr we did say in a case that came down rather recently in the Sapple case that South Carolina just didn't get it, it didn't pay attention to our decision in Simmons.	1
5768518	There should perhaps be some deference, though, to the concept expressed in Article II, that it is the authority of the legislature and some special concern about what the legislature may have said.	1
4144580	Why should we rule on that?	1
6480391	Okay.	1
665342	The other two...	1
8743981	contracted workers...	1
12335	businesses.	1
9439859	Then why... why was none of the money held over for such late-blooming claims?	1
3800123	You agree that if the procedural ruling itself is clearly correct, you don't get a COA?	1
1232396	I'm just a little puzzled...	1
2190653	Well, we have...	1
2276367	It might still be a vessel.	0
2616940	Now, when was this?	1
1572366	This report that you're now describing was a report made to Congress by--	1
4219231	Has the Government taken a different position on the testimonial aspect in the past?	1
5514447	How could it have been clearer?	1
5528165	decision making.	1
2668889	It starts by saying, no statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in advertising, and so on.	1
5502436	I would... I would think that where you say, on the one hand, where it becomes final by (a) or (b), and elsewhere you simply say, where it becomes final--	1
5379139	What do you do...	1
9411674	Well, fine.	1
4441629	What this Court has said, Justice Stevens, is that in...  in many respects the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause are components of the same principle that is...	1
49055	It's not like the State is going to get away with something, is it?	0
8614520	The... the States... all the States can just pass this statute and... and that's the end of this case.	1
4479958	where...	1
3484649	been true.	1
1264381	Are you relying?	1
5111847	I- th- The Court said that...	1
6021936	So as you read Milwaukee, if two ships collide there's no... well, of course, I don't know how you'd get prejudgment--	1
4121318	But didn't that deal with the trading post... the little markets that sell things?	1
7788466	That's your position.	1
4396656	It's it's not in the record, Justice Scalia, but it's my understanding that it's something that is is developed in particularly to deal with the Sanchez case which the Ninth Circuit had already decided, and the presumption that the Ninth Cir- the Ninth Circuit's Sanchez decision went so far and not as far as the im- th- that that that covered the impeachment per- material, but not exc- other exculpatory material think in the reverse.	1
662463	Mr. Terris, do you think the Fourth Circuit may have confused mootness with standing?	1
4064401	which makes it clear that --	1
1472862	Now, once they make that decision, they sweep away the little subsidiary argument which is that it couldn't mean that because otherwise you'd have to allocate, and they say, oh, no, go allocate.	1
1286496	If in that situation...	1
4663032	[Laughter]	1
288715	Could the prime make the same argument, constitutional argument that you're making on behalf of the sub?	1
3445364	Yes.	1
434292	Can Congress fix that up?	1
9126880	And you have no problem with, in God we trust, on the coins and that sort of thing?	1
6917882	We're not able to interpret the things more finely than that, but it seems to me that the suggestion of the question is intuitively sound, and I don't know why it isn't intuitively sound.	1
5378033	The decision below that these transactions were not investment contracts merely because they specified a fixed return to the investor, rather than an unspecified portion of the enterprise's profits, can not be squared with the language, history, and purpose of the Securities Acts, 70 years of consistent SEC interpretation and enforcement, and this Court's jurisprudence.	1
3294273	Well, would you say that a ship coming in at a port in our country from elsewhere cannot be searched thoroughly without reasonable suspicion?	1
2334636	Tell me.	1
8416532	There's nothing false in the information reported.	1
3192914	Excuse me, yes.	1
1051247	The burden, of course, is...	1
776593	In Howey itself the Court...	1
2059371	come from, first of all.	1
1395470	And I wonder if we... we don't just say, well, okay--	0
2257106	Well, what are your... exactly what claims are... is your client now raising in Federal court?	1
4565184	Are you taking coal?	1
8530546	--One concern is that, in the prison situation, the prison is exerting control over all aspects of the prisoner's daily life.	1
1617755	[Laughter]	1
985325	wrong...	1
1200989	I don't think it's an entitlement, Justice Sotomayor.	0
1557951	Mr. Waldman, is your client still incarcerated?	1
9348093	Maybe he deserves stigmatization if... with the high recidivist rate under the facts that Justice O'Connor gave you.	1
3010947	I'm not clear on what you lose at the end of the day if you let the arbitrator decide whether there was a RICO violation, and if there is such a violation, then you reach the remedy issue, and if the arbitrator were somehow to take the position that treble damages were not available, I assume that could then be resolved in court, could it not?	1
4479134	I somehow had the impression that we were dealing here with a crossing that had crossbucks installed under the minimum program for a State.	1
510464	I just wonder why.	0
230274	Thank you, Justice Ginsburg.	0
1669244	That's exactly right, and that's another indication of the fact that Congress realized that this was going to be a difficult provision for employers to enact.	0
1910983	No, the traffic stop is done.	0
9179522	You know, I have just one big problem with your case, and that is the case from this Court dealing not with the taxability, but with the calculation of benefits under statutes using the very same language, where we look back at the year when it should have been paid in calculating benefits, and your opponent is going to say, and has said in the brief, that it will cause lots of disruption if we were to adopt your view in that area.	1
1749569	so that's...	1
6178627	a-	1
222373	It isn't there.	0
8784279	Is the Super Scoop practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?	1
1897663	Because the Ninth Circuit said that wasn't suitable reliance, is that right?	0
8951283	Because there was already a briefing schedule when this turned up.	1
5352898	No, but it is...	1
2460657	Or what about quarantine of someone who has a communicable disease?	1
2124302	And no--	1
8202663	in...	1
8895593	Apparently, to a nonuser of the canal, but flooding the property.	1
775894	There, the vast majority of the courts of appeals have said that you can extend a traffic stop for unrelated questioning, and the courts have looked to how much time does the questioning take, how long is the overall stop, and was the officer reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic mission.	0
88613	They have had a trial under the military tribunal and they have no rights that could be granted at the end of the day, and no mention of the Habeas Statute.	0
2102094	Do we know?	1
2417887	You say until damages are liquidated.	1
7193941	[Laughter]	1
7963399	Subsection B does not talk about rights.	1
459906	but it has done no such...	1
1097837	Even though in conducting the hotel it isn't dealing with members of the tribe?	0
1253317	We're going to restrict...	0
5979909	And what you're saying is, sure, they came up with the number, ostensibly what FERC told them they could do, but they didn't go through the right process to get it, and therefore the number is no good.	1
7599252	Page thirty-five of the joint appendix --	1
1080281	Well, that would...	1
3157597	the the in the...	1
4526163	Well, I... I thought we were... our attention was pointed to a number of instances where the Internal Revenue Service did not require the taxpayer to show all the attorney's fees as income in those class action situations.	1
5520096	What's the answer to that?	1
4281331	of records.	1
8698626	Well, I'm trying to find out what indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys attempting to represent here.	1
5317993	Well, the attorneys for the Federal agencies dealing with it certainly took that position.	1
1716565	And--	0
2546861	I suppose we could posit a situation in which officers think that a really big drug ring is cutting heroin in a particular apartment, and you certainly wouldn't expect them to knock on the door and say, you know, are you guys cutting heroin in there, do you mind if we come in and look, and they say no, we don't want you to come in and look.	1
1990900	All right.	0
3628730	That doesn't say, talk about health.	1
464983	Well, there's certainly no ex post facto problem there, is there?	1
7213507	They never did that, they didn't do it in the...	1
8505903	I...	1
4670633	that he may have been committe -- that he may have committed,	1
8025333	the brief of the...	1
4040573	That's correct.	1
809310	Was that the instruction given them?	0
8553927	Well, yeah.	1
8983364	--because they don't really exist?	1
77287	You're not prolonging it, Your Honor, to do a records check.	0
3305505	Yes, Your Honor, and and I think with...	1
8564112	If it is authorized, is an off label use always allowed--	1
4251487	Does that influence our interpretation at all?	1
1411987	And what basic responsibility does that entail, would you say, the fact that the Government is a trustee?	0
3983463	That's the opposite theory one way, it's very simple case that way.	1
1310633	In addition,	1
9595140	Even if you sue him in a contract action in California, and you prove what you have represented to us you could prove, i.e., that you performed everything you were obligated to perform, including paying the prevailing wage, even though the findings were that you had proven all of that, the prime contractor still would not be liable to you under the contract, because it was engaged in a dispute with the State?	1
1565205	Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:	0
1188734	Mr. Cole, do you know whether there are any license... city licensing schemes that say if the... in the administrative proceeding it's determined that the license should issue and it is the city that's appealing, that then it has to be expedited?	0
6596996	So why does it make any difference if they simply, instead of picking one percentage, charge 5 percent on the parimutuel and 34 percent on the slot machines?	1
4991577	I mean...	1
646761	Do you think it's open to us to reconsider aspects of Williamson County in this case?	0
3932149	Is it... is it operating now, the business?	1
5957877	But the coal that's ultimately extracted is in no way less valuable, is it, because there has been a drilling that preceded the extraction of the coal?	1
7415830	--Am I right?	1
4141399	And have we applied a more circumscribed review over the means of effectuating those policies?	1
9282381	Yes.	1
9030716	to the nursing home.	1
5074002	Shouldn't that have some weight in our interpretation?	1
1893957	In other words, there are grounds...	0
2712660	be a scheme, at least as I read it, just directed at when Federal funds are going to be given to a school, and you determine that by whether the school has a particular policy or practice, and and the remedy is withholding funds.	1
7253843	You have to... you would have to concede that it does.	1
1998579	No.	0
3721768	Mr. Phillips.	1
2375388	I thought we were looking at aggravated felony, and does not Florida make it a felony, a serious felony, if you cause serious bodily injury?	0
8991111	And therefore, why isn't the appropriate action for you to take, to go back to FERC and say, the number they're claiming under your authority is the wrong number, tell them it's the wrong number?	1
7690218	this...	1
6871389	Uh-huh...	1
5192470	Well, what...	1
7745672	Okay.	1
1974433	Well, I suppose if there was no appellate court jurisdiction, we're not going to resolve the merits of that question.	0
122674	It means they...	0
3079381	Wouldn't you like to see it if it went against you?	1
5191816	They'll receive that call, respond, get in touch with me, and take seriously what I have to say.	1
8517931	And as to that, it seems to me the guilty plea can stand and the only question that, it seems to me, I would have would be with the sentencing, and I'm not sure that has to be overturned.	1
267240	So it boils down to what we meant in Steel Company--	1
1792833	Some, but apparently never claimed that the administrative law judge should have ordered a consultative examination.	0
6016364	there're potentially...	1
3699772	reinforcing this statement?	1
5343042	As defined in the statute.	1
3546124	Am I right?	1
8521017	Well, it's not...  the...  the only reason that the Eleventh Circuit decided that this case couldn't go forward...  they couched it in terms of jurisdiction, but it's really failure to state a claim...  was that this instrument had a fixed 14 percent return and said investment contracts can't not include that...	1
7480667	that...	1
590574	--in hourly rate?	0
790622	Was that the instruction given them?	0
7301525	After the Federal district court in California proposed to enter the order it did, did your client then ask for an amendment of that judgment or explain the problem, or ask the court, look, here's the problem, we want to go to Maryland, would you clarify this and make sure that we're not bound or prevented from going to Maryland?	1
537434	I got pulled over for a driving offense, then it -- it -- then it is over.	0
3471259	In that case the Court seemed to be impressed by the fact that it wasn't... any one State could never have control of that organization.	1
1851271	the act.	0
8274957	Well, it seemed to be driven by its very narrow focus on generic drug development.	1
5784762	I... I think what you'd have to say is, it means those two perhaps plus some others.	1
4002417	Some percent of the time... I'll give you as much as you want, but it's not going to be more than 50... it's diverted for, let's say, flood control purposes, and now we have to say that the causation problem is solved by saying, you know, one, this water wouldn't have been substituted by some other water, and the second thing is, you have to apportion the damages, I think.	1
5968808	Thank you Mr. Schaerr.	1
4245731	Now, what should we do about that?	1
2110953	Could I ask about Virginia law, whether if there is newly discovered evidence that could potentially be exculpatory, that is discovered more than 21 days after the conviction, does Virginia bar any proceeding in Virginia courts to determine the fact?	0
2169507	because it's one thing if we're deciding a...	1
6100531	I mean I'm not asking it argumentively.	1
3725658	beginning with the first...	1
951625	I'm asking you what your answer to Justice Ginsburg was, whether you didn't agree whether it was a deceptive contract?	1
895806	--Ms. Bohr, at the Appeals Council level?	0
9055473	So you're saying they're using the wrong category: project.	1
5921350	Under the jurisdictional--	1
7366545	And so to try to redetermine that at sentencing and not to offer any evidence in mitigation, do you think we can say that's reasonable?	1
1224299	We think--	0
321024	You had a second answer.	1
8499466	how would...	1
9092251	Well...	1
3504539	Would you say, nonetheless, it's still punitive?	1
4086137	indiscretion...	1
947124	If they had a policy of not prosecuting minimal amounts of possession of marijuana, then I take it, it would or would not be reasonable to go in?	1
3824375	You must go beyond that.	1
1198509	Mr. Salmons, are you relying on exigent circumstances here because it was a drug case or not?	1
2490752	It mentions prevailing party, and I suppose your argument would be that he would say this means that the nonprevailing party is the one who has to pay the fees, and he's not a nonprevailing party under 285.	1
407284	on...	1
5611243	dispersal of business...	1
7503460	Didn't she, a couple of times, hint that it would be... might be a good idea for defense counsel to seek a continuance?	1
9309005	What... what is... what provisions of the Constitution specifically are you looking to?	1
2939705	You're talking about the two individuals, but they've been dismissed.	1
659838	It's a procedural due process claim, not substantive due process.	0
2001459	First, where the defendant inquires about appeal rights, and then secondly where there are circumstances indicating the defendant may benefit from such advice.	0
697121	But there wasn't a second petition there to which it could relate back.	0
1767586	Right, and you don't have anything in opposition to that, except you say, well, he could change his mind.	0
5036287	No.	1
5765104	Is there... under the amended statute, is there such a procedure?	1
6349429	Title I is both fatally overbroad in achieving any Federal interest and nonsensically underinclusive.	1
1760766	Shall I start over?	0
5339140	We're not aware that--	1
9409863	Mr. Hungar, the railroad industry has been deregulated.	1
1290243	That they say the words, this agreement shall be specifically enforceable in any court having jurisdiction means in any Tribal Court having jurisdiction, and why doesn't it mean that?	1
6423712	It didn't sound like it today.	1
2651931	as I read the advisory committee notes when they added subsection H, I thought the note stated that harmless error review should be resolved solely on the basis of the rule eleven transcript and the other portions of the limited record made in such cases.	1
6305962	Why isn't it a sensible distinction to draw?	1
7733838	so in fact it does...	1
7257291	Yes, and I also have it in on page twelve of the joint appendix.	1
8815181	So...	1
745437	That's an 11-minute traffic stop.	0
7682939	But it has run.	1
3498712	You told me the school can do that.	1
9113093	practice?	1
6792840	Just looking at it...	1
1690911	It didn't enable them to address the issues by briefs, memos, or argument.	0
5309831	provision. You can tell by the...	1
9288502	Well, Justice O'Connor, even if she had gone with well, she f- if she I wouldn't put it as exhaustion.	1
1230011	Well, that then...	1
6512320	Do you understand the Iowa decision to be that there is... despite that finding on our part or that conclusion on our part, that there is no question that what they said in that opinion does reflect the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the result that they reached will be and... and can be found on the basis of this opinion to be the result under the Iowa clause?	1
1346967	I read your brief.	1
5540048	And Darden says, well, we're going to look to the common law, so what makes you think we'd do something else in this situation?	1
8306996	Was probation a possibility?	1
9145580	Well, maybe you... maybe you should tell us later, and proceed.	1
2184694	But I thought, and maybe I'm mistaken, but I thought it directed that certain votes that had been tabulated after the expiration of the original certification date were to be included now without reference to the point at all that their opinion had been vacated.	0
5098375	Is it the commerce clause?	1
1193514	Yeah, but...	0
4509355	[Laughter]	1
5400129	That's been decided, hasn't it?	1
1824517	So it... but it wouldn't rule out a part-time coach, I take it, so long as the part-time coach was an employee rather than an independent contractor?	1
4738701	and on this...	1
353507	--How about--	0
618247	hear that in response to the question.	0
8064257	In the Sandin case in 1995, this Court said that prisoners have a State-created liberty interest only where the deprivation or restraint imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.	1
8014869	You... you think you can show that patented mining claims were allowed for sand and gravel on public lands that early?	1
9572408	That's what it says.	1
1607736	in two years...	1
7517351	I would have thought it was proceeding on the designated broker theory.	1
1159906	But am I correct then... maybe I don't have the facts right in my mind.	1
656023	I mean, where does that come from?	0
6597222	Well, because...	1
8666284	That's our problem.	1
5210514	It just seemed to me that it might be more burdensome on the voter in that situation.	1
8817580	by --	1
2358454	And the Court denied it.	0
706984	Mr. Garre, we'll hear from you.	1
9622922	Because?	1
4618847	[Inaudible]	1
746193	And is there any allegation in this case that the employer failed to comply with that?	0
1826153	And are the claims at all overlapping?	0
3081556	Was this complaint...	1
2887070	The statute... yes.	1
8491950	--to also consider--	1
6634488	And for us, the real purpose counts, not the conceivable purpose.	1
1523535	I think you are reading something in that isn't there.	0
3823245	"""even though you answer yes to one, two and three you also have a responsibility to consider mitigating evidence and if you do so, you may in fact answer this fourth question. """	1
4106979	I thought...	1
5423118	outside world?	1
5056117	material.	1
5335851	-- because it goes beyond --	1
1800633	anybody in the program.	1
1378814	That is dicta piled upon dicta in a sense, because the Court...  we...  I...  we respectfully submit...  mischaracterized Forman, the case that the...  where the Court was concentrating on the difference between someone investing their resources to get something to use, in that case...	1
3871756	here representing -- Right right. Well, I...	1
505187	Was that an alternative that was reasonable?	0
6878948	How about software for particular subjects where you can examine the content of it and don't give it to the school, just maintain the ownership in the public agency, but allow it to be used, or a map?	1
2344202	question put forth.	0
1847704	The court of appeals discussed it.	0
9550890	[Laughter]	1
901735	And in Wallace, the Court stated that, under these circumstances, the district court is in the best position to sift through things and see whether a prudential stay is appropriate.	0
8563838	and endowing police with...	1
7676877	So, then that...	1
6239952	Is that correct?	1
1000651	But wouldn't that have given the courts a chance to go directly to the issue of whether the statute is constitutional?	0
4296363	And now is there anything else...	1
902749	Counsel, it... it looks like the instruction to the jury said that a defendant may only be found guilty of the conspiracy charged in the indictment if he joined the conspiracy at a time when it was possible to achieve the objective of that conspiracy.	0
3212239	That...	1
6409548	Well, the Federal Government didn't adopt your position until very recently, until this thing became valuable, and until then the Federal Government took the position urged by Mr. Phillips.	1
9149817	it different...	1
9610940	is that right?	1
7013567	Then we don't need these facts.	1
1955678	And the Government certainly was not in doubt about the fact that its... it wasn't going to be liable for the fees unless it was in due course made.	0
6749371	You're telling us they have no power to forbid it.	1
1509925	It would be a major step, wouldn't it?	1
4487890	condition had not medically...	1
5885603	But it doesn't... it doesn't go to the kind of evidence necessary to prove the substantive offense certainly.	1
9436936	Well, what are your... exactly what claims are... is your client now raising in Federal court?	1
436193	facility.	1
2044904	[Inaudible]	1
7261931	base.	1
8399965	So the penalty... it's the penalty.	1
4914437	That doesn't tell you who is appealing.	1
785608	--adjudicating the correctness of the application of rules for wholesale rates that are contained of thousands or millions of words filed before the Federal Power Commission.	1
1230811	But this statute--	0
1168292	And that's kind of an indirect sort of a thing?	1
257307	Justice Breyer was much better than I said it.	0
7136102	So...	1
8244669	How many states have a prohibition of this sort, do you know?	1
4252319	Isn't there a difference... and maybe there isn't historically in Tennessee, but isn't there a difference in the fact that intramural athletic contests are sort of accepted as a standard part of the educational scheme, whereas State provision of electric power is not?	1
6914349	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.	1
1332685	That wouldn't have been possible under the phrase, in the advertising?	1
7163099	Uh-huh...	1
737612	So it's... it's hard to say what the sort of cost to the system, if there is one, would be of going one way or the other?	1
498782	And...	0
472452	--Well, and is this affected at all by the fact that the copyright had expired?	1
7569600	Yes.	1
6195249	Well, let me ask you this.	1
4977982	The Promise Scholarship program practices the plainest form of religious discrimination.	1
7140729	be the same as for executing someone with a mental illness? We we have dealt with that, and and with the level of comprehension that someone must have in order to be eligible for the death penalty who has mental illness.	1
9028609	superior liability.	1
1165203	But does not require it.	0
2557475	No.	1
4574166	--Like--	1
646837	Well, at least as far as 24.10's elements are concerned, presumably those could have been addressed by counsel.	0
6942431	Are you reading from the District Court's opinion or from the--	1
1000042	parents, and again I have to --	1
5063671	Do you think they couldn't get into federal court?	1
9412775	I mean I don't know... I'm not sure you get into harmless error.	1
6591616	[Laughter]	1
293295	You want to see that, you want to see this spelled out.	0
5732766	And if so,	1
365408	Didn't we put it... I just took a quick look at Hohn, the principal opinion in Hohn, and didn't we speak of case there in more or less the following terms we said that the denial of this threshold condition does not prevent a case from being in the court of appeals.	1
8539843	In Howey itself the Court...	1
8074019	What's the matter with that if we allow textbooks?	1
6278836	So all this jurisdictional stuff is beside the point, because the rules are fairly clear that there is just... even if it isn't signed, it acts just like it was signed, but it is subject to being stricken.	1
7711647	Assuming they are the same--	1
9339327	[Laughter]	1
4105933	It wasn't until James that we held that immunity applied to anything except property damage.	1
6907002	factors.	1
292748	Well, may I ask a question?	0
1708734	--Ms. Bohr, at the Appeals Council level?	0
8847090	Is there anything that doesn't count?	1
5785710	I...	1
135130	Did that extend only to the GSFF money or what?	0
7524911	Contract disputes are not property under Roth, Zindeman, et cetera.	1
3229608	On the inadequate assistance claim?	1
394013	What about the line of cases that says voluntary cessation doesn't moot a case?	0
2796906	Mr. Anaya, we've gotten pretty far afield, I think, from what we have to resolve in this case, possibly, and there is remaining, as I understand it, a suit by Mr. Hicks against a state official in his individual capacity.	1
1950841	And if I could just give you one scenario where that could occur and then tell you why practically officers often end up or need to do the dog sniff after the tickets.	0
4449207	for the Government to satisfy.	1
8479899	We were assuming a narrow definition.	1
2852243	--by the FDA?	1
1301664	May I just ask this... isn't it true that the Government itself classified... has class I water and class II water that goes through this project, and that class I water would never be flood water?	1
4012547	Your answer is it violates substantive due process or nothing.	1
3996427	I think it does.	1
1106007	Well, I suppose it does from the standpoint of the management required to make this scheme work.	1
8787583	Well, if the university is saying, we want every student to pay $ 50 a semester to an activity fund and we require that and it's going to be used for these activities, then why isn't that government speech?	1
2352115	Is there any leeway, if you will, simply because the technology is not yet available to filter perfectly where it's evident that there isn't a huge percentage amount of things that are being excluded, but the software isn't perfect?	0
3009215	I thought you were...	1
5911244	I agree with you on that, but I now suffer from Justice Scalia's question.	1
1668561	We're dealing with prospective relief.	1
5841817	Well, how could... how could attorney's fees at an hourly rate be applied on any basis other than work performed?	1
2716593	--Well, in all events, I take it that he could be a nonprevailing party for two reasons: 1) that he just doesn't fit within the purpose and intent of 285 as a substantive matter; 2) he could be a nonprevailing party because he wasn't in the litigation as a matter of due process.	1
4667310	Well, what about attorney's fees in class actions?	1
815310	If you agree with them, then summary judgment was wrongfully denied to the police officer, is their view, I think.	1
3395169	First page of the blue brief?	1
8980856	Do you contend that the prisoner has a freestanding First Amendment right to offer legal advice to another prisoner?	1
1873444	Well, what if we think that's not correct, that it is not the equivalent of a guilty plea?	0
939034	This is a suit, a diversity suit, between an Australian entity and a Virginia company about a rail accident on land, and why do you think Federal law applies?	0
7408463	That is to say even though a deliberateless... deliberateness instruction was not given, you don't concede that it would have been irrational for the jury to find that since this defendant did not have adequate mental capacity, he did not act with the requisite deliberateness?	1
9063953	Is there some law or some case that you can point to for that?	1
1391155	that are attached? Right.	0
288248	You can't say Marlboro, okay, so the bookstore says... you know--	1
2580387	this or that or the other thing,	1
1533457	Well, the U.S. Government does hold the property in trust for the tribe... the White Mountain Tribe.	0
5790609	So back the prisoner comes with, yes, some that are exhausted now, but adding on some new, unexhausted claims.	1
2150745	And I suppose it can't.	1
1297009	You are responding as though there were no special burden to show some deference to legislative choices.	0
6370858	I haven't heard it.	1
4099807	go through the collection process.	1
1381971	I mean, we don't... I don't have a sense for whether it matters.	0
2054659	Well, I suppose we don't have to answer all the questions here if we were to find that the interest offset is unconstitutional because it taxes income over which California lacks jurisdiction to tax.	0
5643816	But under the contribution to candidate line of cases, those cases do not involve solicitation of contributions to others, such as the chairman of the RNC's ability to solicit money for someone running in the California recall election right now.	1
786758	Well, it's not that the State has to address all aspects of the problem, but is the State not entitled to do something about promotion and advertising to the extent that it encourages underage people to smoke?	1
1813079	And we think the same thing should happen here, whether the dog sniff is before or after the ticket.	0
4805818	[Inaudible]	1
1791349	And are they limited to certain purposes?	0
1319462	a...	1
8745330	Well, could you answer my question?	1
7051866	Thank you, Mr. Minear.	1
8298477	Constitution.	1
5968577	So what are we arguing about, the legs?	1
3518570	But there's no logical distinction.	1
428479	Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.	1
6573486	[Laughter]	1
5974676	And on question two, if I understand you correctly, there is substantial agreement in the courts of appeals that you're correct?	1
2053127	Does that help you?	1
7130781	What could Congress have provided in section 1658(a) to avoid some of these questions?	1
2478379	Well, you kind of want it both ways.	1
4697753	Thank you, Mr. Howle.	1
8068787	Bivens should be extended is a separate question.	1
5189582	Well, that's the question.	1
2348363	And we don't have before us any conflict preemption under Section 514?	0
6729861	True, but we're living under a regime in which things like just and reasonable and public convenience and necessity pass muster, and so it's not clear to me why the delegation here, in light of those examples, is wrong, as distinct from the argument that what the administrator has done does not satisfy the arbitrary and capricious standard.	1
1753790	Presumably that's how these things get worked out.	1
770544	If someone drives while drunk, have they not created a substantial risk of the automobile or the vehicle causing personal or property damage to another?	0
151423	[Inaudible]	1
8732652	Well, but certainly the date changed.	1
7825623	So that might have been a pretty good deal for Mr. Moss, to get all this stuff off of radio and television, where it does a lot more harm to kids, and the risk being that the billboard prescription would be overturned.	1
8105766	And the Fourth Circuit reviewed it after that case had come down, and apparently placed some reliance on that, right?	1
6074996	At the end of the...	1
2405644	Think of this, there is a poor little widow woman who owns it and she can't possibly develop it or deal with it and she puts it on the market.	1
9423580	[Laughter]	1
7826612	General Waxman, whose First Amendment interests are being burdened?	1
8247367	the country.	1
1417611	Yeah, and one of their charges was possession, was it not?	1
7790895	The Master also decided that there had been no undue delay on the part of Kansas in not instituting suit for another, what was it, 17 years, something like that?	1
7958682	I don't believe you can solve 323(b) without going to the very core of the statute.	1
5347842	I'm going to go home now.	1
8282663	Mr. Feldman, will you tell us what the government thinks can be recovered under 502(a)(3) in the way of damages or other recovery?	1
4682990	What if we assume that the subcontractor did not violate the law, everything was fine, the State was just in error.	1
9133820	But in any case she didn't say anything one way or the other about quantity--	1
8178141	to save my husband's life?	1
530738	Thank you.	0
1027313	I... one of the briefs does, the City of Boston, includes in its prohibition against discrimination ex-convicts.	1
1130205	Well, but I read the language in 3626(e)(2), any motion to modify or terminate prospective relief shall operate as a stay, as unambiguous.	0
5978703	it were.	1
1785694	And Congress recognizes--	1
6094209	General Underwood, in the few minutes remaining, do you think you could give us a 1-minute explanation of your views about the First Amendment issues?	1
5108857	I mean, that's a fact question, possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose.	1
326697	[Laughter]	1
3898911	--Well--	1
8695566	system in any State.	1
2008156	I'm always afraid I'm going to miss the deadline.	1
3182837	better to just say we don't accept guilty pleas from innocent people? That's our...	1
812603	cases like...	1
3392204	Now, is that going to be sufficient as a waiver?	1
238214	Is this a kind of refusal to deal case?	0
8525460	Well, Mr. Ginzkey--	1
8900185	that...	1
8130837	Iowa... the Iowa court made the statement, as I understand it, that the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the national Equal Protection Clause had identical requirements at least for the purposes of this case.	1
4489633	That wouldn't do it?	1
1284698	And if it is, then you're just wrong about it being only a defensive maneuver.	0
4642717	Well, I thought the issue was whether the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit correctly determined the scope of the exemption.	1
4500594	Well, certainly it doesn't...	1
510232	How do we distinguish the dog sniff cases, where we've upheld the use of police dogs to sniff luggage for narcotics?	0
1746702	Public attitudes regarding cigarettes were not nearly what they are today.	1
9269718	was it not?	1
4026745	ordinarily used...	1
5105470	up.	1
2432171	I mean, if the Supreme Court of California says a law meant one thing, we don't come in and say it meant another.	1
8970167	We strike it, but before we strike it we give the person a chance to sign it.	1
1485495	Maybe you should have.	1
4614043	Apparently, to a nonuser of the canal, but flooding the property.	1
2691157	And we've given a lot of discretion in prison administration.	1
4164972	I would have thought the right question is, of the area previously available for advertising, in how much of that area can you no longer advertise as a result of this, and I can't get an answer to that question from the map, and the map only covers Boston and not the suburbs.	1
852662	Just before you do, Mr. Sutton, I want to double-check on one assumption I'm making.	1
1141931	Those are confidentiality...	1
8962208	All right.	1
1441061	I mean, this too seems to me an area for caution, is it not, in importing wholesale public forum analysis in the library?	0
4503540	long...	1
6707162	That could be true, but to continue the question that the Chief Justice asked, do we at bottom have to apply a clearly erroneous test here to the determination of the facts?	1
1490525	--Unless the pondering is to avoid the diligence, and that would be the question.	0
7218784	Do you think the States would have reacted differently whether they knew how this case would be decided?	1
622153	There also are due process allegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand what the precise due process violation is that's alleged.	0
2911954	is not I...	1
4511077	If I could turn just for one moment to the application of a procedural default rule to the facts of this case, in... if the procedural default rule were to be applied, the question at the time of collateral review is whether... is whether the defendant has introduced extrinsic evidence not available in the trial record in support of this claim of ineffectiveness, and the court of appeals in this case found that there was no extrinsic evidence material to the claim of ineffectiveness introduced in the affidavits on which the petitioner relies because the affidavits suggests avenues of inquiry the trial counsel could have pursued that trial counsel in fact did pursue.	1
7611057	That's right, and what Lindh involved was the substantive requirements for habeas, and it said this would be retroactive if you applied the new substantive requirements to a case already filed.	1
279681	And what are the other examples of Congress' choice to regulate States alone, exclusively under the Commerce Clause power, rather than general legislation?	1
218115	I mean, if we were just reviewing the verdict, you might be right.	0
1912656	That...  well, that's correct, Your Honor.	0
8759119	I mean, if you're right, there are very few lawyers in the country who will understand it, let alone the judges and all the courts of appeals, and who knows what they've decided, and the certificate isn't the most... the name on the certificate, whether it's CPC or some other name, isn't so important, and all of a sudden appeals are generated, and the law's about the same anyway, and so why isn't the simplest thing just to say, this is part of the case?	1
6788556	--In Alaska, not in person, I take it.	1
629152	--aren't some of the Indian gambling casinos in fact being operated by private casino interests such as Harrah's, or something like that, that just pay over a percentage to the tribe?	1
3574524	This is not a... a Pullman abstention case here.	1
7527339	entitled, then I agree...	1
2150772	So you want us to say something else here.	0
8263182	I was just saying that.	1
7438352	Your Honor.	1
1694488	How... how are we supposed to define that term?	0
7721701	can also write...	1
9262987	The defendant.	1
5660146	Suppose we say it was unreasonable.	1
4411001	And there are some states where the national party under this regime is going to be constrained to participate even in state--	1
624538	Now, would you be here would you still be here if he had not said anything at the opening? Then what rule applies? Suppose the defense attorney just totally remained silent in the sentencing phase.	0
1096562	There's not one of those statutes that limited investment contract to a variable return and excluded fixed return, was not one of those cases under the Blue Sky statutes that excluded fixed return investment contracts from the definition of investment contract.	1
8795073	Does the legality depend on the fact that the warrant was ultimately issued?	1
1877899	Well, I thought we'd held in Allied-Signal that it violates the Due Process Clause--	1
6503051	So...	1
5465637	--before you have to sit down.	1
8571201	Do you think that that case would stand up under your analysis?	1
5141036	And of course, which except for property damage wasn't even necessary, because the Federal Tort Claims Act--	1
1015633	a durational...	1
6495063	Thank you, Mr. Howle.	1
2910390	O'Connor.	1
7597725	But under the statute we have here, you have affirmative steps that have to be taken for the rest of the person's life if he's a violent offender, to report four times a year.	1
9586584	And Congress recognizes--	1
8633033	Let the public make... you know, the later... later determination.	1
2456587	So now say we'll apply our own State notion of what equal protection is and... and that's the end of it.	1
4047672	But you say it's not fugacious gas.	1
4207918	The defendant wants off the hook, and don't you think the jury can say, gosh, we listened to what the defendant said, but after all, the defendant doesn't want to be convicted, and can't the jury say to itself, and also, the defendant sat there the whole time and listened to everybody else.	1
4578545	Well, here the Federal courts apparently concluded that there were some issues that ought to be raised and litigated.	1
371277	You have probably labor relations problems as a result of having somebody put at risk on the job.	0
5751432	The Federal issues?	1
3812050	Are... are there separate questions?	1
5088955	Do we know where the village...	1
1090446	Okay.	1
1547749	Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.	0
7211312	Well, you just gave--	1
9435358	used specifically  here.	1
9254461	as long as we have an adequate...	1
4186725	of the statute.	1
8795371	When I was reading that provision, it wasn't clear to me that it applied in this situation anywhere... was there any finding about what that stop order, and some other suggestions you had, would do?	1
3420195	Let me ask you another question on the ex post facto lawsuit.	1
6073421	It was their intent to inform so that the thing won't happen again.	1
249417	Is this--	1
1023654	Was a FOIA claim open to the respondent here? Could could such information have been sought and obtained theoretically under FOIA?	0
4867716	Was the so called Penry instruction on paper at the time of this resentencing hearing, the law that is in effect in Texas now?	1
8595296	--But your--	1
4872539	First page of the blue brief?	1
2232592	Wouldn't that be up to California to do?	0
6722203	Well, what does the judge do, then, faced with this mixed petition with exhausted and unexhausted claims--	1
5099571	the listing...	1
2363965	And if not, why not?	0
8652757	Well, it's not...  the...  the only reason that the Eleventh Circuit decided that this case couldn't go forward...  they couched it in terms of jurisdiction, but it's really failure to state a claim...  was that this instrument had a fixed 14 percent return and said investment contracts can't not include that...	1
3754239	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.	1
5487698	9, 6, 3.	1
596635	--if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?	1
5585095	Now, if the Court were to adopt that definition, imagine the size of the super highway loophole that would be created in the Securities Act.	1
3381167	I would sug-	1
1275289	I can't see much difference.	0
7248148	And if you don't do that, we strike it.	1
1247669	tips that they may have...	1
6531437	--Do you think it is proper to leap from these general psychological generalizations about the society at large, and State employers in particular, to the conclusion that the States have been acting unconstitutionally?	1
325773	I'd find it hard to say that with a straight face.	1
7479940	It's not out of his own pocket, is it, the principal, when he goes to the board it's on State time, or municipal time, whoever hires him?	1
6028188	You're not--	1
3933111	On the reservation trust land.	1
2773818	Thank you, Mr. Stein.	1
7246306	--They can't blame it on us.	1
563356	Well, do you think it's fair to read the complaint that was filed as putting anyone on notice that it was a veil-piercing case?	1
6635572	Well, within that limit, right, but the different--	1
5182913	so we wouldn't be in this mess?	1
8354005	That was the first time you argued, when you were here before, one of your arguments was--	1
5239190	With regard to 323(b), the statute does pervasively regulate state parties from section 323(a) on.	1
2784077	--It isn't clear from Williamson County that this Court envisioned two... two separate determinations of fact issues: one in State court and one in Federal.	1
3567009	And I doubt that this is the first... is this the first case in which they've said we... we follow Federal law on equal protection?	1
7551966	But...	1
5345197	show.	1
6146045	Everything except the coal, but did they know exactly what the coal was?	1
2257717	duration, because if...	1
5424859	[Laughter]	1
1318980	Nobody went back and said, hey, we don't need this now?	1
2152899	At the end of the day, what happened?	0
7851035	Or at least we ought to be sure that they can keep these records in a practical way, and we don't know that, do we?	1
9143018	Every ad in every location is banned for cigarettes in Massachusetts, that's not preempted?	1
4486705	N- n-	1
2280391	--Well--	1
995129	Isn't it simpler to just recognize that these plans are covered despite the right to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably necessary for the support?	1
2104628	I mean, you're saying it's not property.	1
4964327	I'm saying that...	1
776882	But don't we have to look at what Hawaii has done, not what Congress has done?	1
2276543	has anyone...	1
858355	And what basic responsibility does that entail, would you say, the fact that the Government is a trustee?	0
6826007	That seems to be--	1
4921239	the record.	1
8939013	But that can't be the whole rule.	1
1741532	May I just...	0
8055283	Which?	1
6567234	Mr. Hurd, I... there's one part of the statute that may be troublesome, and that is the prima facie evidence provision.	1
2701206	So how does this work?	1
28695	The courts just don't review it.	1
1601589	The first is Section 323(a), the across-the-board criminal prohibition on national parties can be well contrasted with Section 323(e), which addresses Federal officeholder solicitation.	1
1460453	If there are no questions by the Court.	1
3088251	You're saying that Congress can't give this to the EPA unless it holds the rein pretty tight.	1
5945435	the same. That C and D provision-	1
9641867	[Laughter]	1
1206473	--analysis?	0
5571058	All that's there now...	1
6862177	What's bothering me...	1
2736364	I'll ask...	1
7363875	Dow case...	1
3410089	So there are going to be some situations in which a court of appeals can resolve an ineffectiveness claim at the time of direct appeal, and in those situations, it seems appropriate to encourage the raising of the claim at that stage in order to promote respect for the finality of criminal judgments and also to promote the resolution of legal claims at the earliest feasible opportunity.	1
9150466	--In Alaska, not in person, I take it.	1
3250024	--Uh-huh.	1
7359653	Well, is there any indication that the tribe would waive its immunity in its own court in this case?	1
5016474	Was your client ever found guilty of any offense at all?	1
776076	But is it in light of Article II?	0
861680	That's the problem.	1
6364944	Is it past defendants?	1
6867281	Has that been determined...	1
9180751	And what if a... a claim is spelled out that necessarily must be based on a Federal right to exist at all?	1
7007785	Even if it's discovered after that time?	1
5404396	I thought you were asking to do more, not to leave... to say the Ninth Circuit test is no good, because it's wholly-related... not-unrelated won't do.	1
3200235	We believe that there is not.	1
5391355	He said, we're not going to give you the money between 1950 and 1968.	1
9210221	Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting that there is some different standard of proof of facts in these cases or that we should not review a factual determination of a clearly erroneous rule?	1
1554631	[Laughter]	1
7999191	I don't e-	1
9605804	That must be something the school itself set up.	1
4655288	I don't know how that should play out in a circumstance as you allege, that a State won't permit any development, so it would be futile.	1
97365	You would be asking us to sit essentially as the court of first view on this theory and to look at things that were never presented below, and that is an extraordinary thing to ask this Court to do.	1
964043	May I ask if...	1
8793631	The Honorable Court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10:00.	1
6647402	Well, to what extent do you... do you mean, Mr. Thompson?	1
8604556	--50(b) motion.	1
969037	Do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?	0
8250689	Or maybe another house that...	1
466385	Mr. Hungar, what is the tentative decision the FCC has taken on the DSL regulation?	1
713830	There were exceptions in Ray.	1
8288297	No canvas or solicit --	1
6828700	Was that ever challenged at trial?	1
5754738	States de-	1
1337295	What's wrong with their argument?	1
1645431	--And maybe that--	1
6576893	Yes, Your Honor.	1
98444	That's why we think there needs some leeway for the officers to take some time to pursue -- to pursue the things that they observe.	0
2917863	Well, that's not true.	1
746490	I mean, if it's...  this was for the benefit of the court presumably, and the court says, I don't need it, thank you.	0
9211786	Okay.	1
8252168	What section of the OSHA would you point to on that?	1
2132690	--in the arbitration context?	0
3864250	Now what I'm trying to--	1
4388538	Is it jurisdictional, do you think, here as well as in the court of appeals?	1
716803	Don't you think the Doyle case cuts against your position somewhat?	1
1095232	And in terms of the distinction between appellate counsel calling into question trial counsel's ineffectiveness, and trial counsel calling into question his own ineffectiveness, Justice Kennedy, this Court in Kimmelman observed what I think would... is a common sense proposition, which is that trial counsel is unlikely to bring into question his own competence at trial and, in fact, he would... he would create a conflict situation, and therefore the system just doesn't operate on the assumption that trial counsel should be required to identify his own ineffectiveness and bring it to the attention of the trial court.	1
7365043	They set up some procedures, you don't like them... sorry.	1
4802417	inmates who participate in the program. Yes.	1
1682549	First page of the blue brief?	1
342613	And she was under oath at that time, I assume, to tell the truth.	0
9536145	--need for a--	1
4958717	You have to get a license, and there's a defense if the person doesn't have that license.	1
378341	To... to get some kind of liability under the Lanham Act under a reverse passing off theory.	1
8804577	It is property, before it's asserted.	1
1829686	Did the Court below have a chance to consider tailoring it more narrowly, as you suggest today?	0
4891830	arguing?	1
5992056	You concede that by saying each substitution affects the compactness and appearance.	1
1052595	I mean, we don't... I don't have a sense for whether it matters.	0
3173597	All you needed to do was just say the signature is curable after the thirty days, right?	1
8409333	Well, may I just ask you this question?	1
6964451	There's a kind of black hole in this case.	1
6885600	Well, this case isn't as extreme as that, is it?	1
5757315	I thought your... the point you were making is, you look to see what you are complaining about in the State criminal process, not when you get to the district court complaining on habeas.	1
3946700	I... I'm not affected in where I live.	1
663836	section...	1
4321249	the court of appeals...	1
2388283	The question is, how much?	1
8279918	which requires an answer within so many days. It's simply a heads-up.	1
2333859	Well, I guess in the area, though, of presidential electors it could be that that court, as all courts would be, have to be informed, at least, by the provisions of Section 5 in reviewing the laws enacted by the legislature of the state.	1
7156548	That's correct.	1
5815024	Mr. Dumont, we'll hear from you.	1
8491312	It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market.	1
49741	conviction...	1
277741	So of course you allocate it back.	1
7545266	You can issue a COA only if there is a substantial claim.	1
710089	Yes.	0
4999165	I mean, take a look at Rule 1... it says when these rules provide for filing a document in the district court, the procedure must comply with the practice of the district court.	1
5775631	Was it good enough?	1
5464076	It said, you can't, under... consistent with due process, hold back this money, isn't that right?	1
2003992	What... what constitutes that--	0
692752	What... I'm having trouble hearing you.	1
900815	What if--	0
661653	of the combined uses.	1
1853505	Well, what... what--	0
4377717	plaintiff's working history.	1
3645145	Mr. Sarnowski, we'll hear from you.	1
7794920	Well, could you answer my question?	1
2057689	In other words, you say seizes the money due, what you mean is, it's a notice that they refuse to pay under their contract with the prime.	1
5130118	9, 6, 3.	1
3881546	Well, you... you have two problems here really.	1
6139078	--Yes.	1
7282577	You should actually be grateful for this--	1
9370433	does.	1
1661629	[Laughter]	0
794790	Why shouldn't those have been presented in the first instance to the State court?	0
6591327	Are there any indications that any of the police in this instance will face disciplinary action for their response here?	1
6316199	Uh-huh...	1
5487368	Well, the Federal Government didn't adopt your position until very recently, until this thing became valuable, and until then the Federal Government took the position urged by Mr. Phillips.	1
2153917	A decision to join.	1
7973562	Two...	1
2054150	Well, normally we would think the trial judge would correct a misstatement of the law by counsel.	0
4965281	As for point three, how do you explain Roth?	1
1358038	So there has been no discovery at all from the policy group, and you claim, of course, that they are totally exempt under the plain language of the statute.	1
682701	If we disagree with you, to the extent we think some application of the district's fleet rules are not preempted, then how does that leave your challenge, which is a facial one?	0
851255	I'm asking if there are any individuals now before this Court in this case--	0
5240030	Yes.	1
3813836	however it might be structured	1
1240340	You... all you have to do is file a motion under this PLRA and say, we file a motion to terminate the ongoing relief.	1
1861223	Thank you.	0
4272780	[Inaudible]	1
7043549	Mr. Phillips--	1
6783825	But it would probably be even better if we set it at zero.	1
3924131	Well, Mr. Olson, isn't Section 5 sort of a safe harbor provision for states, and do you think that it gives some independent right of a candidate to overturn a Florida decision based on that section?	1
8565379	Statements of witnesses, for example.	1
1897119	Now, is the Government espousing that or what?	1
4458399	Polidoro.	1
8889603	that's actually...	1
4089431	pushing it a little far,	1
932266	Is that an unconstitutional conditions analysis?	1
646550	under...	1
7969139	I mean, you have a remedy there.	1
2732275	really.	1
8432224	Right.	1
8826503	Now, I don't think this Court has ever weighed in on that.	1
1580591	What if--	0
7751004	Well if if...	1
4505825	--and that the law then would evolve in district court, without any appellate review on legal questions such as exhaustion or procedural default and so on.	1
9239131	What--	1
3685051	With respect to allowing States to regulate the location and the size, of signs.	1
1674051	Mr. Lamken, this case, I think, involves provisions of both title II and title XVI of the act, and there are regulations under each.	0
3027295	wrong...	1
1312820	But, of course, the discretionary relief provision was changed, too, wasn't it, and doesn't afford it now for people convicted of this type of crime.	0
2792471	It is a boundless proposition that leaves the states no room to legislate on their own elections because they contend... you're exactly right.	1
8094351	It still seems to me quite as--	1
7674540	Well you're...	1
852889	One is, as I think you're suggesting, that the time reasonably required to complete the traffic violation means that time and nothing else, so that any delay attributable to a dog sniff as opposed to other--	0
4669943	Court, Your Honor.	1
5696581	You mean even the speaker or the person taking the statement.	1
6387388	Well, Mr. Strauss points to subsection (b) of the statute as indicating Congress did contemplate giving some leeway.	1
629223	At some point, I think the Government made a Section 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss this suit because the statute was unconstitutional.	0
5601105	And the district court didn't deal with it, and then it went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and it didn't deal with that issue, either.	1
6759518	But surely the inquiry is a factual one, not some directive from the Corps of Engineers that says what may occasionally happen, you know, what has in fact happened with respect to the Madera Canal over the last 10 years.	1
3307503	Is that okay?	1
586008	or --	1
1068745	do nothing. Oh  tell me the answer. Yeah.	1
7927501	anyway t- t- to use an example.	1
5217134	Well, I... I suppose a lot of credit--	1
350185	If the tribe has sovereignty status with regard to this property, then presumably this city can't tax it.	1
4333061	Where...	1
356071	I mean, that... that's just manufacturing something.	0
2433930	Now what I'm trying to--	1
1026939	Your point is... excuse me, your point I take it is that in your view the trial judge should have granted summary judgment to the officer, is that it?	0
9507083	[Laughter]	1
1448301	--one of the questions?	0
152500	Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented?	0
3327673	--What is the Government's position on a State law that prohibits adult bookstores from having a sign in the front which says, adult bookstore, or a sign that says, pornography on sale here--	1
9601744	I mean, relate it to this case, if you would.	1
3488858	--Well, Your Honor, under the Buckley line of cases, you have never addressed a Federalism issue before because the currently, the currently existing, the pre-existing campaign finance statutes were by their terms limited to contributions for the purpose of influencing a Federal election.	1
2078403	But that issue is not here.	1
7765584	I don't think we will.	1
7967305	If the agency has given it a reasonable construction.	1
9264750	--for a State to tax--	1
5778775	Assume you lose in this Court on the interpretation of the contract, I take it that the tribe would say that they're immune from suit in their own court as well.	1
125015	As far as as...	0
3272590	In oral argument this morning they said there is just no basis for that.	1
9246362	There are four circuits that have held that there is no preemption of that.	1
323563	Justice Souter, the best that we can tell, and this is based on essentially anecdotal reports of U.S. Attorney's Offices, it's somewhere on the order of 20 to 40 percent, roughly, of cases in which new counsel represents the defendant on appeal, but that... I'd... I hesitate to rely too much on that figure, because it is based on the anecdotal reports--	1
1955212	Is that not--	0
2241239	Well--	0
6800663	This the Federal circuit...	1
4102102	substantial gainful activity.	1
4702214	leaves to the...	1
9597617	The two dates, or the findings with respect to the two dates struck me as being at least possibly in tension.	1
1778230	[Laughter]	1
5945198	on it did have it...	1
3496607	they can.	1
8973665	--And you think that based on smoking and health is a reasonable way to say, that regulates assertions of?	1
7410569	It's the--	1
5339012	Well, let's look at this very case and tell me whether the result is any different at the end of the day under Roberts versus your test.	1
8192550	No, but it may well have been part of the legislative deal.	1
2335496	No, Your Honor.	0
925452	And and at that wi- i- d- is it also true, as I think you allege, that the seniority policy does not create legally enforceable rights in any employee? No employee wanting to come in would be able to sue to get that enforced.	0
1542171	Is there any indication that the principals act in anything other than their own best--	1
2554029	--With respect, Mr. Olson, I mean, I think that's what's bothering us.	1
1767292	Indeed, that I'm wrong, or indeed, it is?	0
1276691	that are attached? Right.	0
8378363	Well, what does the judge do, then, faced with this mixed petition with exhausted and unexhausted claims--	1
1386394	98 percent?	1
4668811	So the danger is that contributors to political parties are using those contributions to somehow corrupt the candidates?	1
9414836	It isn't just wrongful.	1
507244	That's why we think there needs some leeway for the officers to take some time to pursue -- to pursue the things that they observe.	0
2377546	Yes.	0
229594	Under your theory, if... if the defendant is judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if the statements are defamatory?	0
959420	What if the dog is trained to alert to explosives?	0
9258543	Why?	1
2522182	And the woman lawyer never raised it, is that right?	1
3775244	It was a week later?	1
7199508	for...	1
2218794	they want to identify the people who are going door to door.	1
5149313	I mean  it...	1
884774	Or maybe you can come back to it and your cocounsel can try to find it.	0
5338534	Is a substantial... if we said the... if flood control is a substantial reason for the facility and for the operation that caused the damage, could you go back for trial on that?	1
7401822	assessment in this case.	1
2577969	Let... let me talk about what we have before us here for just a minute.	1
9272760	I... I'm not affected in where I live.	1
7039113	But the Iowa... the Iowa Supreme Court seems to think it could look to what was the real purpose, not the purpose that we could conceive.	1
4952584	Excuse me, yes.	1
2101418	Right.	0
2363169	You know, but it's the... but the question is what does unequivocal mean here?	1
6636843	That is to say even though a deliberateless... deliberateness instruction was not given, you don't concede that it would have been irrational for the jury to find that since this defendant did not have adequate mental capacity, he did not act with the requisite deliberateness?	1
2048427	--for instance, in public schools, as has already been discussed.	0
2091507	May I ask another preliminary question?	0
5624600	drug...	1
873733	That is correct.	0
2294956	Would you say that that was a factor that ought to be considered, even though the membership was predominantly private?	1
362462	The facts that are left is not enough to -- to establish any type of reasonable suspicion.	0
5741323	I mean, is that the way it works?	1
6094584	I say, when you get to the garden, I don't want any of those gardeners walking with their muddy boots in the house, and so here's what happens.	1
8554435	Thank you, Ms. Fox.	1
6702296	You mentioned the multiple appellants, and that was the problem of one person filing a notice of appeal, putting down a lot of other names, and you didn't know whether the other names really wanted to appeal.	1
1364960	Do you call witnesses?	1
1998611	[Inaudible]	0
6341814	Well, why not do the simplest thing?	1
837534	in the statute...	0
5139892	Would you comment on that argument?	1
9463243	How do you distinguish Roth from the ordinary contract case?	1
133065	Mr. Davidson, am I right in thinking, in relation to your opening remarks, that the States, when they came into the Union, as this was an inducement, could not have been contemplating the asset of this gas, because practically there was no way economically that it could be extracted?	1
6049714	General Olson, what does the record disclose is the percentage of lawful material that is excluded under these software programs as opposed to material that is unlawful for the library to--	1
596458	I mean, how... how many times within that 20 to 40 percent category do we get into an argument later on as to whether 2255 can be availed of because, in fact, a... a record was sufficiently developed to... to raise the... the claim on direct?	1
1310561	fund shall be given to an agency,	1
3115382	[Inaudible]	1
5166440	reasonable beyond a reasonable doubt, yes.	1
504780	The courts have generally accepted that.	0
1881205	Because, I've listened to a lot of vague language.	1
1666401	there should be an exhaustion requirement? You have to at least go with a FOIA request?	1
5116424	This discussion is a...  has a little bit of an academic quality in light of recent congressional action, I take it, which now is out there telling the States that if they don't have these privacy protections they will lose Federal transportation funding.	1
771942	Could it include punitive damages?	0
8808674	Yes, and the out-of-State producers are not.	1
8676028	Why would we not do the same for this section 1?	1
8140036	Yeah.	1
578934	--where do we get that?	0
726500	Thank you, Ms. Bunn.	1
8326591	Why doesn't that--	1
299994	--to manipulate the luggage?	0
5308394	And after all, contractors are in business.	1
1901707	That is something that the -- that the courts are looking at as to whether that is something that you should be able to do.	0
9600814	Well, certainly it doesn't...	1
5137006	But you...	1
5875141	that's a legitimate...	1
1681838	Well, but in one of the arbitration clauses, I think, it says the arbitrator shall not vary or ignore the terms of this agreement, shall have no authority to award extracontractual damages at any time, including punitive or exemplary damages.	0
5096594	What is the message that the advertising tries to convey?	1
8703596	Thank you.	1
2766920	that it would be.	1
2934952	Well, there are other ways to do it--	1
7816402	Suppose it's a young child--	1
7089194	--when it comes back?	1
8885113	opinion.  I thought that was the heart of the opinion.	1
1531508	Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.	1
3714350	Was there any evidence that the jury cards in this... in the actual trial were marked or noted on the basis of race?	1
8829809	Assume the Corps of Engineers opens the valve and they do it the wrong way.	1
1846192	And let me ask you, is it often that roadblocks are set up just to get information like this?	1
9463961	The honorable court is now adjourned until Tuesday the twentieth of January at 10 o'clock.	1
4911814	is privileged.	1
3551353	Well, which... which indigent defendants are the attorney plaintiffs asserting claims on behalf of here?	1
6664716	But Rule 11 says that you have to sign it, so if it's not signed, here's what we do.	1
6719744	Yes.	1
1978393	This... this... your client I guess was convicted of several counts.	0
7771287	Becaus-	1
671321	Yes.	1
1805235	And so to try to redetermine that at sentencing and not to offer any evidence in mitigation, do you think we can say that's reasonable?	1
7364844	--because they don't really exist?	1
6701790	Is it in the joint appendix?	1
1573518	[Inaudible]	1
675301	That is not... I would respectfully submit, Your Honor, that's neither narrowly tailored nor closely drawn, not even rational.	1
9535333	Well, in effect you want the opportunity to go back and establish that the water in the Madera Canal has never been released in connection with flood control purposes.	1
3841416	Mr. Anaya, we've gotten pretty far afield, I think, from what we have to resolve in this case, possibly, and there is remaining, as I understand it, a suit by Mr. Hicks against a state official in his individual capacity.	1
770834	And yet, what you have just said again would indicate that's not a consideration in setting the standards.	1
764828	Yes, Your Honor.	1
3399980	But you gave it...	1
8113564	And the tribal court declined to what?	1
7557138	So it's generally a small percentage.	1
4857270	Can you explain, because this goes to the heart of, I think, of our understanding of your case, why your argument relates to delegation as opposed to the arbitrary and capricious stand, the point at which we ended up with... with your brother.	1
4020031	[Laughter]	1
95957	So in your view this case boils down to whether section 3501 is sufficient--	1
4993014	I guess the C. A. Fed. applies a clear error standard.	1
6076692	That could be true, but to continue the question that the Chief Justice asked, do we at bottom have to apply a clearly erroneous test here to the determination of the facts?	1
1305185	mean somebody higher up the ladder in the employing agency?	1
4953985	It would be a major step, wouldn't it?	1
7768196	Well...  well...	1
9131515	--need for a--	1
5513021	I would have thought it was proceeding on the designated broker theory.	1
2757462	Based...	1
5599341	and that --	1
3218484	And one wonders why the Government wants to take such a... an extreme position even though it lawfully could.	1
1739767	Sure.	1
2552346	how would...	1
1837175	Now, here, the supervised release was ordered in connection with the drug offenses which--	0
9327040	And they can say how long their time, how much time will be allowed for that burden to be borne, which has an obvious economic consequence.	1
5419789	Let... let me talk about what we have before us here for just a minute.	1
8132241	Well, what case of ours do you think most strongly supports your view of this jurisdictional question?	1
8333159	Well, I thought we'd held in Allied-Signal that it violates the Due Process Clause--	1
3529991	For instance, if I read this clause about, you know, you can bring suit in any court having jurisdiction thereof, if the tribe were taking the more limited position, which I gather the United States is, that this was at least an agreement to suit in the Tribal Court.	1
1980393	discussing. Th-	1
308864	I mean, that's what it suggests anyway.	0
1515644	manner t-	1
7101440	But does the subcontractor have a contractual right against the prime or not?	1
1117800	It's...	0
881655	how you got there. Uh-huh.	1
2259738	Well, the Federal Government didn't adopt your position until very recently, until this thing became valuable, and until then the Federal Government took the position urged by Mr. Phillips.	1
2085705	And somebody comes along and knows the regulation is there but says, look, that regulation is going to have to be applied in a reasonable manner, I'm going to pay you X amount for this property and then challenge it.	1
2234455	law, but there is no...	1
1135556	--I think we would -- we would not include the time for a dog sniff--	0
5399329	--assume, for a moment, that we didn't; could we, nonetheless, address the active inducement--	1
590216	I think not collateral estoppel.	0
1135163	Is that what you're referring to?	1
1735046	Isn't it there also an efficiency in just sending it back for new trial right away, rather than going through all of the other claimed errors?	1
2698941	in your view?	1
4663049	Right?	1
3414203	They certainly don't apply retroactively, but what constitutes a retroactive application of them is another question, and I don't consider it a retroactive application of them to say that they apply to all cases that seek an appeal after the enactment insofar as their provisions governing appeals are concerned.	1
3174937	Yes.	1
7535128	Well, Your Honor--	1
1093642	Well, we're not talking about job elimination.	0
6466726	I mean, at that...	1
9587448	May I... may I ask you, Mr. Benner, if you take the position that all 13 of the provisions before us here are preempted by Federal law itself or that some of them are preempted by Coast Guard regulation?	1
7006586	At the end of the...	1
6420907	the prison...	1
6421451	And it can be filed by mail.	1
2481128	That's what mechanic's liens are for.	1
2957980	There would be immunity there?	1
6129281	privileges because of the injunction...	1
3171810	[Inaudible]	1
2243750	[Laughter]	1
1778929	But you said they couldn't do that on remand.	1
256432	That...  well, that's correct, Your Honor.	0
126374	It--	0
5138456	But you'd have no equal protection argument at all if they didn't let you have the slot machines.	1
1548655	Well, but this is a good question, and what is your position?	0
4458040	--Your Honor, that is the Solicitor General's position here.	1
271171	You are looking at the vehicle itself.	0
5196338	Unless made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the constitution.	1
3406615	--if we agreed with you here on the blanket primary thing, wouldn't we be casting some doubt on the open primary system as well?	1
4724996	Too bad.	1
6819746	They'll receive that call, respond, get in touch with me, and take seriously what I have to say.	1
9186095	Counsel, would... would the new Dastar video qualify as a derivative work that would deserve copyright protection on its own?	1
21790	Well, let me ask you this.	0
1840706	No.	0
4553352	Very well.	1
5217911	--He does have an incentive not to have a lawyer, because you're better off without a lawyer when you get to court.	1
7597583	At least there's language to that effect in its opinion.	1
1392097	Jurisdiction under Habeas Statute?	0
2943457	ordinance have to do more?	1
2432724	Now, many notes, or many types of offerings, might be based upon a fixed return and might appear in the...  to look like notes or fixed return types of investments and still be investment contracts.	1
2761025	What part of the Constitution would it violate, if any?	1
1890213	Was it well established that engaged in commerce was narrower than Congress' full power?	0
675472	The -- I have lots of questions before as to what is part of the mission and how far you go.	0
7645273	But it doesn't... it doesn't go to the kind of evidence necessary to prove the substantive offense certainly.	1
8092916	General Underwood, you have three minutes remaining.	1
7508805	[Laughter]	1
1914196	That's... that's just very hard to understand.	0
955157	Mr. Hood, don't you have a law--	1
8347930	What is clear here?	1
7607880	The court says May 1.	1
7385025	What's the purpose of emphasizing that?	1
1135230	do you propose some per se rule, as Mr. Devine was arguing, or are you advising us to stick with the Terry reasonable suspicion/ totality of the circumstances?	1
4784379	Are you disputing those figures or not?	1
5601174	get the argument out.	1
3584	The statue...	0
440144	Mr. Stewart, would you be able to give us any examples of municipal safety regulations that are preempted by this section as it's been interpreted below?	0
5657521	You mean, ever, for anything, no matter what?	1
8475408	Against whom?	1
2057022	provision that I asked you about was made in nineteen ninety-eight, so that was well after the beginning of aggregate assessments.	1
8343417	That seems to be both contrary to what the Illinois, Appellate Court of Illinois found, and contrary to the assumption made in the question on certiorari.	1
3285822	It should have given the power in the first instance to the administrator.	1
2591995	in this matter?	1
1351797	We don't have to decide it here, but it's looming.	0
2242074	Yes.	1
7344959	depending...	1
6499983	And it includes IRA's apparently because of the last provision in the statute referring back to individual retirement acts under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.	1
2239176	Does that have to be considered then in the balance of qualification?	1
8548911	[Laughter]	1
4513564	Why should we say it is State action when he is doing absolutely... the prime is doing absolutely nothing more than the prime could do under the general law of contract?	1
3088230	Why does it give you a standard simply to add, add economic effects to the thing.	1
6506585	they weren't...	1
9473776	I thought that's what you wanted to ignore.	1
2922075	What makes it look like a...	1
5603843	Does the general policy that underlies their doctrine of stare decisis have any bearing on what we should do with this case, do you think?	1
8508894	term...	1
1999227	And he claimed that he intended to apply to transfer to the University of Michigan, from wherever he was going to school, and yet the transfer admissions policy, I guess isn't before us.	0
4840471	Well, not necessarily.	1
7710983	Yes.	1
520438	No, Your Honor.	0
1955958	--a jurisdiction that has taken a rather extreme view of what the Lanham Act protects.	0
2068439	Now, here, the supervised release was ordered in connection with the drug offenses which--	0
2197377	--No, they thought... Nierotko was very simple, really.	1
6742750	mine, that it was...	1
8825876	the...	1
4999433	petition.	1
4194072	Now, this may not be...	1
8176641	the listing...	1
276280	Does that make a difference, particularly if the governmental unit itself takes the position that it would disagree with this determination that the Boy--	0
1631964	And so we don't get beyond all these other things.	0
1207028	Well, but B...	1
2185260	The official capacity suits have been dropped.	1
296577	"Ms. Kirkland, assume for a moment... I know you don't agree, but assume that the court, or a majority of it, were to hold that California appears to be a ""weighing"" State."	0
570551	Let's assume that it can be demonstrated that eating regularly at fast food joints, including McDonald's, causes health problems throughout life for kids, would you give me the principle in your reasoning that would prevent the State of Massachusetts from similarly restricting advertising by McDonald's--	1
2003620	Yes, the problem is you have Western Nuclear, which said that gravel was a mineral.	0
5884560	legitimate reason to do it, potentially...	1
201896	doing though, really is kind of odd, because the the result is that back pay awards to illegal workers are likely to be greater than to legal ones under this board's policy, and that's so odd, and it gives the illegal alien an incentive to try to phony up more documents and to extend for the longest possible time the charade that the worker is here lawfully, and that's that's surely strongly against the policies of the immigration act at the very least.	1
853507	I mean, if we were just reviewing the verdict, you might be right.	0
4344374	Could you do it under any branch of California law?	1
4941606	--Well, but then again, that assumes the answer on your part.	1
9287962	Well, Section 1519, enacted subsequently, comes closer to the mark, doesn't it, than 1512?	1
7774799	In their individual capacity.	1
3486463	--Well, let me ask this.	1
9411641	Do you think that an instruction to the jury would be appropriate...	1
8557858	[Laughter]	1
7490894	You said the riverboats.	1
4113396	--Don't other states have the possibility of pursuing private bills, of pursuing--	1
9395221	But then... then you might--	1
1589454	Now, should we propose such a rule or adopt such a rule in our supervisory capacity?	0
5897949	Proving the racial motivation was predominant, then you've got to have strict scrutiny to see if it was justifiable and all the rest.	1
2038710	Now what I'm trying to--	1
2743375	And we have a representative of that commissioner here before us today saying that under the statutory and regulatory scheme, that payments such as these for foster care are in the best interests of the child.	1
236320	Yes, but her question didn't just ask you about the Eleventh Amendment.	1
6290550	Well, that's the issue.	1
7086742	If it is authorized, is an off label use always allowed--	1
324461	That's what we're here to decide I think.	0
2198641	Yeah, and one of their charges was possession, was it not?	1
5117761	Well, England was an abstention case and had to deal with the effect of 28 U.S. Code 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Act.	1
2246994	[Laughter]	1
1364309	Yes, but this is in some ways a sort of derivative cause of action that Trinko brings with...  with the primary injured party probably being AT&T.	1
3895587	I don't want people knowing what my...	1
7362512	Well, are you assuming from Justice Breyer's hypothesis, Mr. Roberts, that the policeman who has spotted some suspicious... that these people have previously been convicted, or that this is just the... the beginning of the whole story is that a policeman spots someone?	1
8936551	[Laughter]	1
6601016	Well, if there's never been a trial date set, how could it be a continuance?	1
1528494	Why... why would it not be ex post facto in that case, whereas it is in this?	1
1601133	In the past.	1
2344261	You're on the moon.	1
2757592	I mean, usually these things are done for the self-interest of... of legislators from various districts, and... and as long as there could be a rational... I... I would have... I'm surprised it took you so long to answer that question.	1
1678299	recognize...	1
2201169	Total fact-based issue.	1
2606062	Well, my problem is, if you do it in this kind of suit, which is under a compact, I presume you would have to do the same thing in a parens patriae suit by a State against another State, wouldn't you?	1
5836289	Uh-huh...	1
332775	Could it include attorney's fees, do you think?	0
4602159	choice but...	1
1817977	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.	1
671312	Whatever view it took in James was dictum.	1
4806040	Like what?	1
7824459	Is the Super Scoop practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?	1
790752	And I I would I would a-	0
7015884	So what's the tax   so what's the employer...	1
2831274	Not in this case, in all cases.	1
1035333	requirement.	1
1220610	The Gov- the Government...	1
2721158	9, 6, 3.	1
679496	In habeas?	0
4865924	They just weren't easily available.	1
4158058	Justice...	1
5541317	because the British...	1
4605186	And by subjecting them to taxation, it's going to drive up that cost.	1
7543474	I think I have some question, they did say that the owner hasn't sought permission for any use that would involve substantially less filling, but having left us with that lingering doubt they then rush into the merits.	1
3129101	That's...  that's correct, Justice...	1
1843865	--Okay, but is that properly before us here?	1
7511007	--Well, the... the evidence was quite clear.	1
8631173	Precisely.	1
77860	be a scheme, at least as I read it, just directed at when Federal funds are going to be given to a school, and you determine that by whether the school has a particular policy or practice, and and the remedy is withholding funds.	1
16973	--and that there was a finding by the trial judge on it?	0
1690438	Is it this contracting for legal, accounting, or other services necessary for the operation of the plan?	0
8747187	--telephone lines have always been subject to common-carrier regulation.	1
1839336	I thought actually that there were five members of the Court in Lee v. Illinois to say that confessions of a co-defendant are presumptively unreliable for purposes of Roberts.	0
1152813	--Back pay was attributable to '86, '87, but it's paid in '94.	1
6496237	the sorts of things...	1
4936700	You acknowledge that at least that has been broadened to the extent of saying, no statement shall be required or prohibited, I suppose.	1
2683740	In 323(e)(1)(B), there is a specific allowance for Federal officeholders to raise non-Federal money up to the analogous Federal limit for state and local candidates.	1
5917560	There were exceptions in Ray.	1
4270644	Would there be any conceivable reason why Congress would have wanted a higher damages award for hard-to-detect misconduct of the type under little (i)?	1
1470975	Do you think the candidate is asserting a right to require the State to facilitate his fundraising in some way?	0
2835847	[Inaudible]	1
5528368	Well, how does some liberty interest and reputation survive the Paul versus Davis case?	1
1972847	That seems to be both contrary to what the Illinois, Appellate Court of Illinois found, and contrary to the assumption made in the question on certiorari.	1
9386302	Do you... do you think that any other provisions of the Communications Act are enforceable under 1983?	1
5896746	How about the reasons for the regulation, should the Court look at that?	1
8894892	Why?	1
586161	The state is arguing that you can respond to evidence which you believe in this particular way.	1
5981996	That's one of the problems...	1
3367461	--And maybe that--	1
7435371	We don't want to do it if you think it will hurt you.	1
2143454	Well, one of the things that is somewhat troublesome about some of the briefs in front of you from the other side is that the other side is looking at this as though it were a penalty.	0
256430	No, Your Honor.	0
682687	thirty...	1
8918895	But just to explore this a little further, let's suppose the lawsuit was brought by the prisoners and it was determined by the court that the prison was putting six people in a single cell room that would properly hold only two and that it was a violation of the Constitution, making it cruel and unusual punishment, and further, that the prison was providing only 1,000 calories of food a day, whereas to sustain normal weight and life, 2,000 calories a day were required.	1
265675	the e- failure to...	1
7902763	Well, what Lindh held was essentially that there is no retroactivity provision in section 153, and therefore the normal rules of nonretroactivity apply, and the normal rules of nonretroactivity for a statute that sets forth the substantive requirements for habeas would not apply that statute to any cases that were filed already when the statute was enacted.	1
5506083	Thank you, Mr. Minnis.	1
3748975	In this case, did the plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer confusion?	1
1662875	preponderance when it comes in the MS PB...	1
3490404	months,  the disability...	1
1170673	--I don't think that's how we envision the analysis going, because the ultimate length of time has to be within the duration of a routine traffic stop that doesn't involve a dog sniff.	0
1952127	Relations Board?	1
8591738	You can interpret it as you wish.  Yes.	1
4829796	Well, again it's not a question of not paying attention; it's a question of whether it can be cured, whether we know that the thirty days can't be cured once that runs, but the... the question is whether something like the signature shouldn't be curable, when everything is there, his name is... is in the caption, his name is in the body of the notice.	1
4982474	I mean, it would certainly have avoided a lot of problems.	1
5977505	And the district court didn't deal with it, and then it went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and it didn't deal with that issue, either.	1
3537613	When you get to the second point, and I don't mean to spoil your order, but will you sort of take up where we left off on the problem that we... some of us seem to be having in finding that there was knowledge, or should have been knowledge in '69.	1
655393	But those grounds would be hard for us, really, to address here for the first time, at least on the grouping question.	0
9552679	--Why is that implausible?	1
1086010	The sixth requirement was that the affiant knows of no other person whose evidence or attendance he could have procured at trial by whom he could prove the same facts.	0
5520215	Mr. Sutton, you have 1 minute remaining.	1
4691022	And making it simple for people you just look to the... the quarter or the year in which the money was received, and that's when the tax is due.	1
753819	I would have thought we wouldn't, that our cases would have said not, that wouldn't be enough to waive sovereign immunity.	1
8835071	[Laughter]	1
6142598	Thank you, Mr. Stein.	1
5600962	Shouldn't that have some weight in our interpretation?	1
3691370	argument...	1
1389151	The reason they don't want it is because they think cigarettes are bad for you, and they don't want people to know what they are.	1
4945855	specific...	1
2933903	--as that term--	1
7882745	Yes.	1
2390696	Number one, you said our own cases show that a... a conceivable rational basis cannot be relied upon when the record indicates that in fact that was not the basis for the legislation.	1
1912444	I mean, it just gives them a very impossibly short window.	0
2126882	Well, there was another district, Senate District 15, where the percentage dropped from 62 percent to 50.8 percent, and the Government didn't challenge that.	1
929024	Is that what's being asserted?	0
2129850	Yes or no.	1
6271049	It would seem to me that if the Court were to strike down these laws, some private business could have a web... a web page, just like credit card companies do.	1
4814098	But wouldn't...	1
4235151	saying that...	1
2159201	Well, let me ask you this.	0
518127	What if a church asks for privilege to conduct church services once a week during the hours the school allows?	0
2389802	Perhaps.	0
5441086	Do you support that analogy?	1
1991661	Do you... do you agree with the interpretation suggested this morning by Justice Breyer, for example?	0
9288700	I mean, if your client wanted to go into Tribal Court to enforce it, I wouldn't have thought Montana would be a barrier.	1
7472324	Well, presumably the person filling the gas tank with drugs had to disassemble the tank to put the drugs in there, so apparently willing to take that risk--	1
4196916	correct.	1
6483016	Three.	1
7401552	[Laughter]	1
7924175	--But maybe there had to be a request, not litigation, but say, tell me, was he an informant?	1
2062225	Well, if Congress never decided it, then you're saying that the 1909 things didn't... don't speak one way or the other to it?	1
2285521	And, under that, you think that Merck was entitled to a directed verdict--	0
1685966	How do we know?	0
561619	Is this anything that the State couldn't undertake to do itself with its State driver's license and so forth?	0
179362	But here you have everybody internal in the same... the same State.	1
4251069	Exactly.	1
1095530	It wasn't their intent to punish.	1
1936255	On the other hand, if in the administrative proceedings, it's determined the license should not issue, then there the burden would be on the appellant applicant for the license to go forward.	0
817332	A fall-back provision.	1
5032518	Is there any rule of lenity concerns or anything of the sort because we are dealing with statutes imposing criminal penalty?	1
7792743	In other words, we're trying to find meaning here.	1
2867158	133?	1
7373750	--explain that to me?	1
2898349	Thank you.	1
635800	Would that survive?	0
129462	He felt... the district court said only that Agent Cantu felt the bag, so we really don't know what's involved, more than the passenger shoving it around situation.	0
1153943	In other words, you want to support a per se rule no matter what.	0
7019	There may be a claim under what I perceive to be the substantive due process clause.	0
664748	I thought that's where we were.	1
5263426	So, yeah, overflow is basically a flood.	1
32658	What if the subject matter jurisdiction issue turned on some fact finding that would take place at trial?	0
1818774	No, Your Honor.	1
2510321	Are you reading from the District Court's opinion or from the--	1
2704157	Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law?	1
1549	Isn't there... don't you think your candidates generally feel sympathetic to people who give a lot of money to the State committee, even under the current regime?	1
4098348	Well, it certainly wasn't ruling it out, Justice Scalia.	1
7310579	Okay, but the basic point is, schools customarily play each other in Tennessee.	1
5872298	Would that make any difference in your analysis?	1
1920914	Both of those in turn refer to at least state court and in the American Arbitration Association to state or federal court.	1
7810133	But this...	1
7398942	But if...	1
666630	States have now enacted legislation providing that a retarded person may not suffer the death penalty?	1
8139815	Mr. Olson, I'd like to get focused a little more on this same area.	1
4533738	N- not necessarily.	1
1512697	We have a different system that we think works as well.	0
6409648	There was no economic extraction, then, in that period.	1
3103412	And the village...	1
2496953	prosecuted?	1
1179568	of my time.	1
838909	Why should one statement be elevated over another?	1
722688	So don't we just take that as a given in resolving it?	0
1878561	And the preliminary studies show how...  how much in acre-feet of water year are we talking about, probably?	1
236033	[Laughter]	1
5902951	, but I can't...	1
3455832	It doesn't say it wasn't valid; it says specifically what you do.	1
3095372	Let's assume it would violate the Eleventh Amendment for these farmers who are deprived of the water to sue Colorado.	1
1327594	I mean, that's why it placed the jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.	0
1125783	Well, I assume that if your position were adopted it would invalidate the Federal sentencing scheme that we have too, wouldn't it?	0
8864499	I mean the statute itself refers to that as a cap.	1
1397690	Mr. Lerner, I thought the district court here made some findings in that regard.	0
6550428	Perhaps I misunderstood.	1
9450038	Do you think that would be okay?	1
2313851	Is the principal expected, out of his private purse, to fund his participation in this organization?	1
8406421	Court has addressed the...	1
4713454	Well, we're talking about now.	1
5624205	Mr. Dreeben, exactly how could the Respondent have proceeded to raise his issue of double jeopardy, and... and before what agency or agencies?	1
3799262	So once that's the case, all you have to rely upon is this principle that... that where... where a thing is said two different ways in a statute, there must be a reason.	1
1262290	Well, now, wasn't Ramirez a no-knock entry where the door--	0
8446045	Well, but now this... the funds administered, as I understand it, also include tax dollars appropriated by the Hawaii legislature.	1
1549605	Could you answer my question yes or no?	1
5099482	trial work statute itself says that any services rendered by an individual during a period of trial work shall be deemed not to have been rendered in determining whether his disability has ceased.	1
7434575	objective. But w-	1
7236745	What we want to do is do something to really penalize the racetracks because they're an immoral business, they're even worse than gambling on the rivers.	1
216642	[Laughter]	1
6293107	The homegrown requirement?	1
7431531	--but... but I don't think you carry the day on that point.	1
5924703	You're saying his evidence does not justify doing what he claims, in addition to the settlement.	1
3720995	--that one of your points?	1
364265	And what is it here?	0
1474490	our position...	1
1991746	But the law at the time this case arose was different, and there was no requirement... the labor department couldn't require the withholding, is that right?	0
2792770	Mr. Garre, as has already been pointed out, the interpretation does give rise to some anomalies and interpreting it the other way might as well.	1
2448299	The things above here are very bad.	1
2195661	Now, that case dealt with Rule 3 of the Federal rules, and Rule 3 says an action is commenced by filing a complaint, and this Court said, it does not determine when an action is commenced for the purpose of triggering a State statute of limitations in a diversity case, and the Court in Walker said that the rule did not displace the State's policy determinations underlying its statute of limitations.	0
1957587	In the --	0
7631271	strategic decision...	1
9529828	Well, what do we make of information such as that provided by the State of Pennsylvania, talking about the application of the permit system to interbasin transfers in that State and saying how beneficial it has been?	1
2680778	--State action?	1
6181844	Well, why not do the simplest thing?	1
1524035	Certainly the Restatement and the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on this.	0
7977574	Do we start with the presumption that the legislature drawing a district plan acted in good faith and with proper motives?	1
8886775	I...  this is the...  from the one circuit that holds otherwise.	1
1559920	He's relying on... that's why you have an expert witness, to some extent, upon the credibility of the expert witness.	1
6792480	Why isn't that a sensible reading of 2255?	1
9102850	Mr. McAllister,	1
6916932	Why isn't it perfectly reasonable to look upon these laws this way: Iowa is taxing a business which has nothing but table games at 20 percent on all the table games.	1
6853665	If the discrete situation applies in the accident, why shouldn't the discrete situation, in effect, rule apply here if they can show by the records kept by the dam that except in, let's say, five instances in which the canal was used for overflow for flood control purposes, all the other water that was diverted into that canal was for nonflood-control purposes and therefore you would get your immunity on some apportionment theory?	1
7456710	There may be some Privacy Act concerns, but still, this is truthful information.	1
7563675	Well,	1
8044830	just at the word impairment and what it means, you get back to the a- inability to do substantial gainful employment for that interval of time.	1
6243299	[Inaudible]	1
2343326	I think that does create arbitrary results from the perspective of the intrusion on the individual.	0
3488520	tried after Apprendi came down, there might, in fact, be a notice problem I assume.	1
1715553	--all we're doing is looking at the statute.	0
5091829	I would have thought we wouldn't, that our cases would have said not, that wouldn't be enough to waive sovereign immunity.	1
9007300	Thank you, Ms. Bunn.	1
6276978	They just don't keep it.	1
4777371	I would think you would win under an objective test.	1
228836	And we would then have to consider... what +/?	0
3237928	Widespread.	1
5576498	Well, that changes the approach a little bit.	1
7558562	Under law 280.	1
7817601	Was it good enough?	1
1828493	Are... are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?	0
5688978	FICA...	1
6750456	And how do you distinguish Lopez?	1
3061323	It's a jurisdictional issue and it's your burden.	1
3150246	Now, does it totally drop out after there is evidence put in or what happens to that presumption?	1
2326098	It's at...	0
9375875	[Laughter]	1
4336733	--as... as applied section 1738.	1
6378444	And that could have been raised before.	1
3739280	Which was it in the restaurant?	1
1619868	Without a statute that uses the word shall enforce.	0
2090512	Do we owe any deference to common sense in recognizing that when Congress draws up campaign funding legislation, it is more likely to draw up a system that favors incumbents and is it not true that this rule of course favors incumbents because the one who suffers the most when he can't get significant funding from the party is the new candidate, the unknown face who is running against an incumbent?	1
770966	Thank you.	1
142135	Now, that was enacted, was it not, in 1887?	1
8282701	The only rationale we've gotten is Congress can condition the statutory right simply because it's Congress.	1
4436246	--I thought, frankly, that he had appealed in March of 1996 and AEDPA was enacted in April.	1
971230	It seems so odd that this appeal would go to the Federal Circuit.	1
249455	If there's an arguable issue for appeal, then an attorney has a duty to advise of those appeal rights.	0
4809858	It might be more difficult and expensive to extract the coal, but the coal itself is no less valuable, is it?	1
2255947	Do you know?	1
6169781	But the fact that you haven't gone to court doesn't seem to me to have any bearing on whether you have a property interest or not.	1
2669458	That's how I would read it, too.	1
1422533	whether this is harmless error?	0
2838934	I think...	1
2855509	after-acquired evidence rule.	1
6793026	[Laughter]	1
1913049	Suppose I believe a life sentence is appropriate but I don't believe a life sentence as reflected by a negative answer to a finding to the issue under consideration; I don't believe it is appropriate as reflected by deliberation; I don't believe it is appropriate as reflected by lack of dangerousness.	1
4980820	denominated adult.	1
5653827	Yes, but didn't we... no, please.	1
5307597	or not. But I know they...	1
9461703	In other words, is it conceivable that a statute which is valid in response to a facial attack could nevertheless be invalid as applied in particular cases?	1
439472	It...	1
3179865	Wh- What's...	1
9139646	So all -- all you have to...	1
1906917	Well, the buyer takes it expecting to have to make a Penn Central type takings challenge.	1
4928640	But Senator Levin, on the day he introduced the Levin Amendment, said that the statute would go too far.	1
757689	explain that he wouldn't be presenting any evidence or saying anything more?	0
2046876	The Court never thought Congress was talking about taxes.	1
1682573	Mr. Zwerling, would the prosecutor have been entitled to a jury instruction that the jury could draw an adverse inference by virtue of the fact...  as to guilt by virtue of the fact that the defendant had sat in the courtroom the whole time?	0
6789959	something...	1
1603584	They're suspicious.	1
4568502	Does that mean that every application of that statute that might subsequently be challenged would have to come up with the same answer?	1
4919591	That's true, but unlike those other statutes, this one is limited to the navigable waters of the United States.	1
1255626	You don't dispute the State's recidivism figure, do you?	1
4404191	It seems to me what happened here is that it originally went to a federal district court judge who granted an injunction and then it was appealed--	1
2978897	let me tell you what troubles me a little about the Government's position in the case, and I hope you will address it.	1
2369629	at the...	1
3469725	entire...	1
6176284	Well, does the Federal...	1
3852371	I'm not... I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
7956451	So the Court said, we're going to look at the cases that involve the Blue Sky statutes that...  that had been in existence and had been interpreted prior to the adoption of the 33 Act.	1
3184301	Right.	1
546437	insisted upon...	1
6559569	that's the alleged motive, that that could provide a basis for a suit for denial of access to the court.	1
666958	only.	0
1505358	Now, should we propose such a rule or adopt such a rule in our supervisory capacity?	0
756159	Do you think the candidate is asserting a right to require the State to facilitate his fundraising in some way?	0
4730291	Nothing expressed?	1
2222106	You mean the first degree burglary conviction--	0
550069	And certainly what the First Circuit did seems in serious tension with this Court's cases.	0
7066428	Until there's a judgment, then.	1
6407526	And I I would not disagree with that.	1
588470	But I don't see how you can call it substantive, if it's just going to witness competency.	0
1533057	I mean, that's a fact question, possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose.	1
8747936	See, I don't understand that at all.	1
5352670	What was being discussed in McCleskey was a constitutional right, so it makes perfectly good sense there to talk about... that language wasn't intended to cover the whole scope of habeas.	1
3010841	But you do say that this was a single, particular job.	1
498239	--and another to engage in a separate study as a precursor to the off-road vehicle thing.	0
8486213	I understand that, but I'd like to know what your theory is.	1
6881708	So there has been no discovery at all from the policy group, and you claim, of course, that they are totally exempt under the plain language of the statute.	1
1759485	She's making...	1
9577146	Absolutely.	1
1996931	But you do concede that the Department of Labor views it differently.	1
9397525	--You sued the... and why did you not sue the--	1
4377178	That is the assumption--	1
5055012	I thought they were given a flyer saying if you...  read this and see if you observed anything that could help us find the hit-and-run driver.	1
451423	So we are talking about the first degree burglary--	0
958423	Does he intend to continue making the same comments that he made before?	0
8756333	It's marketed like other schemes that might have a variable return.	1
656220	If so, how?	0
2899473	I have never seen... you say any government other than an Indian tribe government could make this argument.	1
2150978	It's within the states' jurisdiction.	0
1037543	We're not talking about the Fourth Amendment and the officers and open season on the officers and what the officers can do.	0
8785466	How are these regulations based on... the ones that you say are prohibited, how are they based on health?	1
5657932	And what... what are the issues before the court there?	1
2089027	Well, the other most troublesome point for me, anyway, is this Court's decision in Allied Bruce, which dealt with section 2, and said that we're going to interpret it now as reaching the full scope of Congress' Commerce Clause power.	1
4176919	Excuse me.	1
6710004	case.	1
121472	We have --	0
6302716	She couldn't have -- could not have...	1
4087638	--Is that enough, then, to exempt them from that interest?	1
646756	They say the bulk of the gambling is in private casinos, so we're hitting the bulk of the problem by this ban.	0
520521	But it... it's a 2-year statute of limitations.	0
2269946	Okay.	0
8084957	Don't blame it on me.	1
3456761	Court has addressed the...	1
7364365	Can I go back to your first point?	1
5997278	What if the plaintiffs below show that never in the history of the Madera Canal has that happened?	1
1864231	There's a kind of black hole in this case.	1
254082	Would you talk about what the system is here, because I found it a little hard to understand.	1
3818415	No.	1
1024546	Th- that is certainly the contention, and there have been, however, no facts to show whether that's that's true or not, because in each of the cases, not only the Ninth Circuit below, but in each of the other three cases that we cite in our brief decided by the Seventh, Eleventh, and the Federal Circuits, no evidence was ever submitted to show that the tips were overstated...	0
581743	has drawn that distinction. W-	1
918394	Thank you.	0
1173625	The honorable court is adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.	1
5744111	In other respects it looks punitive.	1
812723	Well, what does the judge do, then, faced with this mixed petition with exhausted and unexhausted claims--	1
459988	And someone would have been convicted after the change but not before if that's the only witness.	0
1723937	Is that possible?	0
3092449	And is all of that land practicably irrigable as the...  the cases deal with that term, all 25,000 acres, or some smaller portion of it?	1
6303453	Okay.	1
4989866	or would you say it's a right...	1
3687252	point is even if this Court were to say that he- it's unconstitutional to execute a person who's mentally retarded, presumably it would still be open to the State to determine whether that individual is mentally retarded under the State's definition, or is there some Federal definition you're asking us to employ?	1
3438559	I can't practice a particular profession, but I can go out and get a job.	1
1986223	search...	1
1964588	Legislatures constantly have... are faced with drawing legislative districts, and my own experience is that the motive in most cases is political in drawing those boundaries.	1
8647866	It can have a voucher program, but if it does, it has to fund all private and religious schools with a voucher program?	1
966590	Well, no, Your Honor.	0
3533023	history  just...	1
4708761	--as applied to this case.	1
1699143	And how do we extract from the question presented the result that you... you ask us to achieve?	0
8953638	No, you misunderstand me.	1
3755983	Which was withdrawn, as I recall, after this litigation began.	1
2879475	service jobs, once a quarter, are all declared open?	1
4676362	The regulation specifically says the individual... the threat to the individual can be considered.	1
5161425	--or in the determination to have it?	1
51798	--And that's true with gunshot wounds, and it's true with teachers who see children that have been beaten by their parents.	1
2458295	agreeing...	1
8983704	don't...	1
847299	It was under a different act, not the Pittman Act, but certainly very similar.	0
1224421	Here's the problem with the reasonableness.	0
1114749	we also relied on prior authority that made some reference to lack of control.	0
8050292	Is there any case of ours where we have so held?	1
3438002	that...	1
5031863	Is it... is it the obligation... is it the minute the fuel is brought into Kansas?	1
2143617	How about a detention center of some kind, as opposed to a prison?	0
7742563	That's right.	1
3624312	Because this is the fear that some of them might be.	1
1628473	So if that's right... I... I mean, you're not... I don't think you can show the first.	1
8816928	focus on...	1
1926197	Would what, Your Honor?	0
3184722	I wouldn't think so.	1
589779	Now, is there a dispute between the two sides on that issue?	1
157264	Well, do you say that a tribe can never lose its sovereign rights to land?	0
4812331	You have to fill out the form some... four times a year, et cetera.	1
7822920	On those 100 days, those releases put water in the canal where it is at that time because it is flood water, but on all the other days the water in that canal is not where it is, because of any flood control purpose, so we're talking about the water on all those other days.	1
8214340	It just seems like such a complicated, not obvious measure of damages.	1
900688	Section thirty-one eleven at pa- page fifty-five A of our appendix to the petition...	0
1060171	And in fact, did not defense counsel tell the jury for sentencing that they would be hearing evidence about the defendant's background--	0
557542	It says the intent is to focus and prohibit nude live entertainment.	0
8851810	Well, is that not adequate post-deprivation relief, even if you assume there's some State action and some problem?	1
3891642	I mean, it's California's choice to have this scheme, and it's enacted one that does raise concerns of trying to tax extraterritorial income, in effect.	1
9018140	correct in my description?	1
8484215	--But you're not arguing that the agreement precluded this.	1
2686406	That's what I said.	1
3983640	On those 100 days, those releases put water in the canal where it is at that time because it is flood water, but on all the other days the water in that canal is not where it is, because of any flood control purpose, so we're talking about the water on all those other days.	1
1136472	But you're trying to say that this expert was not really an expert.	1
5894539	It's made easy for them by the State... access is made easy... but only access to the bad information.	1
6283191	What we think is...	1
3607316	program.	1
3740083	What would have happened if the disclosure about Albuterol was made before the company announced revenue shortfalls?	1
4643849	All right.	1
2736996	[Laughter]	1
6042144	But I'm asking you.	1
166241	So the respondent has been paid in full, under this contract?	1
6160422	Was he wrong?	1
6045093	It's not known in the other case that a judge determined this... this person had been cured to the extent that he could have the custody of a... a minor child.	1
5548695	Would you agree that that would state a property interest?	1
6656970	You do.	1
2156936	And it wasn't clearly done here.	0
8064431	that you you think reasonable, the word reasonable and reasonable accommodation requires examining what happens to other employees as well as a result of the accommodation, then you have a different question.	1
9670359	Yes, but he gets a 15-percent override or something like that, doesn't he?	1
4434169	the court of appeals...	1
3887331	I mean, the power of Congress to pass the law and to say what it does versus the implementation of it.	1
4880480	Do you agree that it is a totality of the circumstances test?	1
88646	I mean, is that... is it really the police... having to walk somewhere and write something as opposed to sending in a report that makes all the difference?	1
2574496	when the g-	1
6457672	Why do you need a name?	1
1029510	It's a little odd in this Pittman Act because it... it does in section 8 refer to valuable minerals, but at various other times in the act, it just says minerals.	0
2805089	I'm... I'm not sure that I think that you're dire consequences scenario would play out.	1
4195487	Becaus-	1
1445392	All right.	0
3998789	What is it about an admiralty case that makes prejudgment interest proper, and not in a common law case.	1
1564719	--on which we granted cert?	0
7669073	Now, I don't think this Court has ever weighed in on that.	1
5773207	But there's... if you would create a symmetry between benefits and the tax, you would be creating an asymmetry between the income taxation of the back pay and the taxes that go with that--	1
6488722	the State law gives.	1
637272	Apparently the miners will be covered one way or another.	1
8673699	Title I is both fatally overbroad in achieving any Federal interest and nonsensically underinclusive.	1
5225940	I do.	1
1368689	I mean, that's what it's dealing with.	0
1758715	Now, this ad could have been run by your clients by a segregated fund.	0
1812281	In both cases is there still an ongoing monitoring or has one of them been concluded at last?	0
336180	drug...	1
2543850	Well, but blessedly there are farmers who want to use it, so of course it's released.	1
6069145	But,	1
7083982	Mr. Feldman, what would you think the result should be for someone whose capital conviction and sentence became final after Apprendi but before Ring?	1
5092233	It's not the same Congress.	1
8091359	Because it's not clear to me.	1
1301635	Is that right?	0
693206	It said, you can't, under... consistent with due process, hold back this money, isn't that right?	1
7708084	No, no.	1
1991227	They were?	0
4056976	Do Tribal Courts normally handle arbitration matters or don't they?	1
9627685	But, here the agreement is for work to be done outside the reservation on non-Indian lands.	1
8643114	I thought that for purposes of deciding the question on which we granted certiorari we simply assume there was no consent.	1
663250	I mean, it looks like the most obvious source of law on this topic.	0
4450615	[Inaudible]	1
1666284	Must the disclosure be made before the ads are run?	0
3059771	Isn't there then a limit on what the party can give him?	1
7275981	do the assembly line...	1
1249358	But it wasn't... it wasn't in the questions--	0
9351788	This is in the Federal court system now.	1
6990549	And it would be the case, I take it, any State athletic association, given the current mix of public and private schools.	1
9250716	and then the...	1
2889709	as a matter of fact, Justice Scalia, what they did say is that and this is on page twenty of the transcript in the oral argument, and there is something similar in the in the brief, that they had that they we can't get back to you or we're not able to respond to you they suggested that that would be a perfectly constitutional response, or as you say, a no comment would be a perfectly constitutional response.	1
5535423	5(A).	1
6883873	is tha-	1
5354753	[Laughter]	1
1648388	Well, Mr. Nuechterlein, do you take the position that there's just a per se rule, that in every case where a defendant testifies, that it's all right for the prosecutor to make this kind of comment?	1
6594960	States...	1
1020946	Yes, and I think that doesn't help you very much when you're trying to transpose that holding over into double jeopardy or ex post facto, which are much more precise.	1
8115370	At least... at least--	1
2844203	It's not even in writing?	1
2692769	How many states have a prohibition of this sort, do you know?	1
5285986	We're not talking about partnership.	1
9124496	I'm not sure.	1
2068119	I'm not a hundred percent sure that's true.	1
933749	And is it a 1983 action, or is it not?	1
1671572	How often are these habeas--	1
485473	Is there a constitutional violation?	0
7921088	Thank you, Mr. Stein.	1
6041127	I'm on 23.	1
2160635	So are you here to say if Washington State's legislature said that for a burglary conviction that a judge can sentence anywhere from 10 to 20 years.	0
738873	All right.	0
5174168	Well, could we talk about whether it's field preemption or conflict preemption or something else?	1
4471011	And it seems to me that what is clear here will perhaps vary depending on whether the subject matter of the contract is subject matter on reservation or off reservation.	1
8809796	Why why did the court of appeals avoid addressing the work approach? It was it because it thought this Court had rejected that?	1
1926687	That's right.	1
454468	"A second rational way to do it... I don't how easy it would have been but I assume it could have been done, would have been with a definition of deliberately and the question the second question I guess, which instructed the jury that a person of some degree of retardation simply does not... is not capable of the mental process that ""deliberately"" assumes or requires."	1
4254923	Is future dangerousness an issue in Missouri?	1
5449451	But, the standard forum selection clause?	1
1700808	That is part of the stop.	0
6762808	That's how I would read it, too.	1
3823894	potentially -- Not...	1
2775738	Because?	1
1308525	As I understand, the riverboats wouldn't make money either if they didn't have the slot machines.	1
7204533	The reason is the following.	1
2785499	Yes.	1
1407316	Well, how about Mitchell II?	0
2251293	We we believe that we after looking at it carefully, we've decided that the Ninth Circuit probably was right under the circumstances, although you could argue it the other way, and that this k- this is an issue that is presented and clearly with respect to the the the legal standard that's been adopted to the N- by the Ninth Circuit and which is in play today.	1
5479956	important that...	1
4650780	probationary period.	1
6716374	It's settled in the Ninth Circuit?	1
2737038	Is there any other effect-- --by virtue of their finding?	1
3753828	[Laughter]	1
9643426	All these things are adult sponsored.	1
1734860	Amendment rights. It would be an artifice.	1
2013254	What's the principle that you think we should adopt in respect to prejudgment interest in a suit between two States?	1
5341621	Well, Ms. Jones, how can you do that?	1
1530033	Well, without deciding, in some instances, like class certification, without even deciding whether there's subject matter jurisdiction.	0
8246737	--you do agree, do you not, that the Government does not agree with you on this point?	1
1870347	Your Honor, I do not believe you would be striking down any states.	1
6092896	Well, you... you have two problems here really.	1
3023584	and the...	1
9647010	I could ask the same question with picking out trucking routes or picking out airline routes.	1
9015218	And for us, the real purpose counts, not the conceivable purpose.	1
2248014	Well, surely it's not a matter of private choice whether a public school chooses to join the association or not.	1
1777101	Are... are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?	0
3449655	there is.	1
1021306	Well, does that have the effect of negating the safe-harbor provision, in your view?	0
2344974	Is that still before us?	1
5756492	And do you agree with the petitioner's attorney that if you look to the common law test, these people would be employees?	1
9474657	[Laughter]	1
8739874	--is used?	1
6248496	Which was identical to the first.	1
2316671	Then can they go... start over again and go down to the trial court and the court of appeals?	0
3582646	though...	1
5219841	talking about...	1
7065083	Well now, what difference does adult sponsored make?	1
2451903	[Laughter]	1
867364	[Laughter]	1
9387406	liability?	1
2953689	Suppose everything is the same, except that the organization is only for public schools, and only public schools compete in these competitions.	1
3094994	I see. Not...	1
1538916	--One concern is that, in the prison situation, the prison is exerting control over all aspects of the prisoner's daily life.	1
5281816	It seems to me that one things that cuts across all the instructions are the special issues that were given to the jury at the very end and with respect to each of the three special issues, the jury was said in order to say no to that, we the jury because at least ten jurors have a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired into in this special issue find and determine that the answer... issue is no.	1
8000938	That's what it says.	1
4556994	Not not be --	1
7034930	and coming back and...	1
504695	--You do if it's done before the -- the traffic stop is done.	0
1756231	It just says there is this cap on attorney's fees, and we know it became effective in April of 1996.	0
3049205	w- Well, no -- my predisposes...	1
6074616	occured...	1
2362141	[Laughter]	1
8037979	[Laughter]	1
7984008	Well, but we've said in McNeil that it's offense specific--	1
6598466	I mean, at that...	1
42397	Is this--	1
9042916	All right.	1
8531548	Do you know--	1
2054815	Yes.	0
5441457	Assume a represented party who has a lawyer... a paper is filed which purports to be a notice of appeal on behalf of that person and not signed by anybody.	1
3474173	Did you address, on behalf of Stumpf, some allegation that he has to be resentenced?	1
9356286	Was the so called Penry instruction on paper at the time of this resentencing hearing, the law that is in effect in Texas now?	1
1768038	Was it 80 percent is in private casinos?	0
6622091	overstated. Yeah. Ri-	1
4904100	And the narrower the definition is, the more it raises the same problems of flow-through to the candidate from identified malefactors of great wealth that, that you're trying to prohibit.	1
1944924	Which circuit court?	1
765197	[Laughter]	1
850146	Excuse me.	0
8114721	that's a legitimate...	1
9398767	What Equal Access Act are you talking about?	1
2286442	What what is the definition of...	1
5161859	property...	1
669730	I mean, if a State requires a certain number of signatures to be gathered on a petition before one can be a candidate, is that burdening the candidate's First Amendment right?	0
1832454	Did we not?	0
5438521	Well, but we now have Milwaukee, that confirms that.	1
1426965	But in deciding summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue I would assume we would assume he wasn't resisting and then go ahead and resolve the issue.	1
4267581	So of course you allocate it back.	1
218746	Well, suppose... suppose somebody, allegedly a former spy, is alleged to... by the Government to have breached the agreement by writing and publishing a tell-all book about it.	0
2023336	We're talking about the Fourth Amendment and the protections that it has on the driver.	0
2985377	In the second part of your argument you're now assuming that signature just means a typewritten signature, so I assume it would follow that if you left that out, it will also be properly filed.	1
1260585	--Well, Mr. Joseph, I--	0
1760675	Yes.	1
2538980	u-	1
6406992	So I... it's hard to get a focus on what... how... how your client has been hurt.	1
6921559	where it's an...	1
7998190	purposes.	1
904131	What we're asking you to speculate on is if the Government prevails and we say, fine, you can take the gas tank off, you don't have to have any degree of reasonable suspicion.	1
6133485	--Thank you.	1
1002686	to State law...	1
369590	But in Whren, the stated reason for the stop, traffic enforcement, was lawful, and we didn't have to look any further.	0
261735	Why not?	1
7016313	On your reading.	1
6880147	Mr. Phillips, you have 2 minutes remaining.	1
1445877	--on regarded as?	0
6822893	term of probation.	1
239262	The court is often not in a... a good position to even know that information as required by the Ninth Circuit.	0
2465926	There are no materials.	1
6806181	Is that constitutional?	1
4565798	Right?	1
2454433	You do not apply the new requirements to all cases that were already filed.	1
1632521	And... and there certainly is language in those statutes dealing with the manning of vessels and vessel safety.	0
7026475	to stop.	1
527074	It would depend, I suppose, on how the program was structured, what the inquiry involving a compelling government...  strict scrutiny would entail.	1
2031469	Yes.	1
8019931	mandatory.	1
3313115	we're speaking hypothetically.	1
7643483	If it's another source, it seems to me that...	1
3766608	can...	1
8563578	You're into First Amendment suspect categories I suppose.	1
6680423	has anyone...	1
1297428	Chevron deference.	1
5493876	Well, I think that's unfortunate and troublesome, I have to tell you, and I wonder if the Solicitor General's position wouldn't be the better view here.	1
889950	Right. Per month. Right.	1
1793086	That is...	0
7080848	[Laughter]	1
559576	Now, that has never been approved by this Court.	1
7788109	What if we look at the videotape and think that is not excessive force?	1
9512514	[Laughter]	1
1818799	In common parlance, we would think a clearly erroneous standard was not as strict a standard as substantial evidence.	0
9509493	district court or...	1
8529787	Are there any indications that any of the police in this instance will face disciplinary action for their response here?	1
2153891	It would be because that would be part of the stop.	0
7730130	When does the conspiracy terminate, in your view?	1
3187503	Is it... is it the obligation... is it the minute the fuel is brought into Kansas?	1
3620441	--That's right, broader.	1
8074927	Are you aware, and you are their lawyer--	1
3143835	Were these findings by Congress?	1
4426727	--Why would it be a closer call?	1
2585329	I mean, here... if I'm very frank about it, there are two competing things here, and the one thing, give weight to the agency, let them define these terms, particularly at the margin, but that's Hearst, and... and the other is, no, no, it doesn't matter what they say, pay no attention whatsoever to what they say.	1
2938959	Well, I gather it's already a stretch to say, as James said, that water which is held behind a dam that is not really flood water, it's water that's been accumulating over the summer, but if the dam is for flood-control purposes we're going to consider all that water flood water.	1
6072644	Okay, and that was a... that really stretched the statute, didn't it?	1
3949544	[Laughter]	1
2779965	--Your claim is an ex post facto claim, a retroactivity claim.	1
2109813	Well, I'm just trying to find out how it works, whether it's like a voucher program, you give the money to the student and the student decides how to use it.	0
5542483	Are you going to address those issues of whether the State is a person and the Eleventh Amendment concerns?	1
8323659	case.	1
4687595	Are they all after 1953?	1
1014706	--came out.	0
861295	I...	1
6067608	The sole basis is what, Mr. Bishop?	1
7930903	this cou-	1
7912912	No. I understand that.	1
278877	I think your position would require us to basically review and... and reverse Two Pesos.	0
4226340	But, I'm still saying the reasonable import of that language, the unequivocal import of that language with regard to a state might well be that you can only bring suit in the state court.	1
4511879	for it.	1
6700175	The statute places the burden on the Government to prove that its position was not substantially justified.	1
8547892	Sometimes there are... there are claims in which there are two bases for challenging the competence of counsel.	1
518049	Also, the probation officer stated in the probation report that he would get 15 years to life.	0
1037626	I mean, or would the results still be the same?	1
5386201	I'm not... I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
7035619	That's what I'm not following.	1
9098165	Well, what statistics are there that support that statement?	1
4903649	Now, what's the answer to that argument?	1
2317772	At only reasonable fee can be a contingent fee?	0
1153086	Now was there a factual component to that issue that makes it impossible for the trial judge to determine or could there be?	0
2136057	Are we just talking pure hypotheticals here?	0
80133	Right.	0
3147943	They were not...  they were not...  some of them were variable returns, Mr. Chief Justice, but some of them were fixed return.	1
1960969	Now, let me ask you this.	0
1563257	I'm just curious how it all plays out.	0
1631344	SATP.	1
1369410	Could the district court have certified the question?	0
2365933	Have... have they asked for years... periodically they ask for more--	0
3142733	That...	1
3248726	in the various...	1
8187027	I --	1
8810493	How would you have done it, Mr. Smith.	1
9059998	Is there any rule of lenity concerns or anything of the sort because we are dealing with statutes imposing criminal penalty?	1
6673550	[Laughter]	1
8594291	Thank you, Justice Scalia.	1
5989314	[Laughter]	1
5376144	You know, there's no doubt that there's substantial... that this is, I'd say, substantially related to flood control, though mostly related to irrigation, the canal, then there's no doubt that some of the time the river, the water that goes through that canal is water that would otherwise be dumped into the San Joaquin, that it was all filled up, but that's a fairly small but still substantial amount of time.	1
6448411	then the statute would not apply?	1
1802300	There are situations like the Reves case where the Court said, well, some notes are securities, some notes are not securities, and then goes through...  what the Court in that case was looking at, a Second Circuit decision that said, well, some notes are not securities, some are securities, and then laid out a methodology, which, by the way, is the same methodology that the SEC understand...  well...  widely understood to employ with respect to those cases at the margin.	1
1402920	There's...	1
1830085	There wasn't anything to which it could relate back.	0
2154205	Well, the impairment...	1
9358282	Is there any case of ours where we have so held?	1
9430475	I thought the statute required that committee to advise the EPA of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance of the national standards.	1
3872941	accept...	1
6110722	So it's... it's hard to say what the sort of cost to the system, if there is one, would be of going one way or the other?	1
7357536	Would you say that that was a factor that ought to be considered, even though the membership was predominantly private?	1
1548770	I think -- I'm not sure there is one, and I think that this type of conduct is so stunning and so in contradiction of our basic fundamental policies that it stands alone --	0
6115849	require a...	1
9092825	They are two separate issues.	1
7856903	I mean, that is supposed to be a summary of common law, is it not?	1
8578487	They changed their mind about this.	1
5250312	Why is... should that be different from what we held in the Milwaukee case for admiralty?	1
4333532	This specific question has not previously been decided by this Court, but the Court has never decided, and the cases that the Court referred to in Howey did not ever say that...  that the fixed return instrument was excluded from the term investment contract.	1
7212058	Well, does... does any entity in a society, a... a nursery school have an interest in... in knowing the background of their employees?	1
2195516	I thought we were looking at aggravated felony, and does not Florida make it a felony, a serious felony, if you cause serious bodily injury?	0
4058346	That's necessary.	1
6570288	--that was a little hard to understand.	1
6326449	bit further...	1
9503333	If the legislature were to start with the higher sentence and then say, but if no gun is used, 3 years, otherwise, 5, that ought to be all right.	1
7668667	You say until damages are liquidated.	1
6286348	Isn't that really what we're saying?	1
314523	I questioned whether it was the whole truth because it has the bad side, but none of the good.	1
7079760	Well, could you answer my question?	1
650152	Johnson...	1
3377371	It's all right for her to have the coins and use them and read them, but it's... it's the... the problem of being asked to say the pledge?	1
4669925	level of   --	1
5262860	the...	1
1459553	Yes.	1
1953631	--So then, if I thought my question was important, then the answer would be... and I'm not saying it is, but if I came to that conclusion, I would then have to think, we should send it back to get this fact developed.	1
4974185	Let's talk about the standard of the scope of review under the statute, 706, which says that under the APA the reviewing court will hold unlawful agency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law, subsection (A).	1
806836	--or not?	0
5601559	People comply.	1
1492570	--Well, can the police approach a person and deliberately elicit statements without advising him of his right to counsel after indictment?	0
6110349	It wouldn't naturally go into the Merced Canal, and if you focus on the month of August, and you focus on the decision to turn it from the San Joaquin below the dam over to the Merced Canal, what has that to do with flood control?	1
8123878	The mirror image of that might be that you have 100 percent immunity if a substantial purpose of the facility is irrigation, and I guess the problem with that from your standpoint is that we're just stacking the deck.	1
7178102	of...	1
5887883	Mr. Garre, d-	1
5088399	But I... but I do think that that's the more natural--	1
169286	--in connection with a birth?	0
4701052	As as a matter of Government accounting.	1
587748	Well, but we've said in McNeil that it's offense specific--	1
723536	And they might change, as counsel for the Government told us, if there were a different mix of school at some future time, but right now, these leagues are overwhelmingly public.	1
3849382	conditions.	1
2923613	--Well, in all events, I take it that he could be a nonprevailing party for two reasons: 1) that he just doesn't fit within the purpose and intent of 285 as a substantive matter; 2) he could be a nonprevailing party because he wasn't in the litigation as a matter of due process.	1
4276742	Everybody knows that.	1
5413821	Who has the burden of proof on the immunity here?	1
1800653	cases like...	1
6928197	We strike it, but before we strike it we give the person a chance to sign it.	1
6200778	Reply brief?	1
8112055	probation.	1
4772378	You say the majority of State laws.	1
5728636	Charlotte is about a million, isn't it?	1
7905656	And doesn't that bring us back to what Justice Scalia said?	1
747825	Well, you made two you made two points, Justice Breyer.	1
1411963	[Laughter]	1
385001	[Laughter]	1
1172198	twenty-one Q in particular.	1
2490331	Well, why and what principle governs?	1
2300107	It... it indicates that... that the most distressing and damaging fact that you have... that you have the conviction is available to the public anyway.	1
5558368	There are new, proposed regulations dealing with this subject.	1
9577228	But certainly the other interpretation is a reasonable one as well, in which case it becomes evidence that predominantly they were trying to put together a district that had predominantly black voters in it.	1
9094003	You said to regulate the person himself.	1
1070910	I don't see how that should affect our determination.	1
4122029	No, no.	1
1839503	Well, what if the house is used... the property is put up to get a mortgage to get money to go into an interstate trucking business?	0
6146030	Just to be clear on your position, do you think that California as a State could enact a law saying that no purchaser of a motor vehicle in California can purchase a gasoline-powered vehicle?	1
91511	base.	1
7020009	[Laughter]	1
8153149	One... one thing that makes it more difficult perhaps than it might be to see your side of the argument... go back to the Chief Justice's question.	1
3028089	Interesting...	1
5324528	You would also have to show that your underlying claim was substantial, and I don't think you had to do that before.	1
9485962	me...	1
1109895	It's a temporal intrusion.	0
4897909	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
1866908	It is...  it is derivatively obtained information.	1
6128374	The Sixth Circuit said, thirty days are up, no signature, that's it.	1
6696958	[Laughter]	1
4161288	To what extent do we...	1
1341242	Because it is a...  it is...	1
8018842	Well, within that limit, right, but the different--	1
7208572	Why not?	1
146714	Congress says should be done.	1
2470355	Well, the...  the references to the...  to the...  this...  from this...  our perspective, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the return must be examined from the standpoint of the investor, the invest...  and the Court...  I don't think the Court intended to restrict in that case, and the language is not reasonably susceptible in my judgement to the...  to the understanding that that was intended to exclude investments or instruments that provided a fixed return.	1
375202	Yes, subject of a foreign state.	1
6266905	So what...	1
927934	I mean, most of the population of Massachusetts, I don't know what the situation is... we now have those maps... and yet I think it's very important to your argument, on my assumption.	1
1697154	service.	0
4675636	That sure doesn't seem to me to establish whether the principal is serving as an agent of the Government or is serving on his own.	1
198224	If someone drives while drunk, have they not created a substantial risk of the automobile or the vehicle causing personal or property damage to another?	0
3420742	Mr. Feldman, you have 4 minutes remaining.	1
3869955	Well, isn't... isn't it authority that goes to the satisfaction of a form and manner requirement?	1
8619919	absolutely the State's position.	1
6333404	--The rational basis is the Republicans have a majority in the State legislature.	1
8642018	Are there... a fairly small number, I would assume?	1
6824243	So--	1
5617337	I gather what you're considering loss to the general economy is the farmers had less money, and therefore didn't buy as many luxury goods at the grocery stores.	1
117286	Was a FOIA claim open to the respondent here? Could could such information have been sought and obtained theoretically under FOIA?	0
2156833	Well, it's... it's related to this.	1
1934374	I think that is part of investigating the -- the -- traffic offense.	0
8952771	Didn't the Ninth Circuit found... find there was no intent to make it punitive, but looked to the effects?	1
3913964	Now, what prevents that from happening, once we get into the habit of awarding prejudgment interest?	1
6224758	--And that's true with gunshot wounds, and it's true with teachers who see children that have been beaten by their parents.	1
3587588	Are you suggesting that the Rules could not put conditions on what you have to do to file a notice of appeal other than this statute?	1
7683690	simply not not...	1
744507	I don't see why the fact that it's boiler plate cuts one way or the other.	1
89492	Yes.	0
2878274	yes.	1
575436	Mr. Shapiro, is there any evidence in this record that the special trial judge in fact changed his report beyond the hearsay affidavit?	0
6695804	[Laughter]	1
3186710	[Laughter]	1
3365531	I suppose we could posit a situation in which officers think that a really big drug ring is cutting heroin in a particular apartment, and you certainly wouldn't expect them to knock on the door and say, you know, are you guys cutting heroin in there, do you mind if we come in and look, and they say no, we don't want you to come in and look.	1
2904025	Can I go back to your first point?	1
8294410	Because I would think your position might lead to the conclusion that that doesn't even set out the elements of a complete offense.	1
9164775	I don't understand how it is that Kansas should not have known enough to bring the suit until 1987, but Colorado should have known that it was wrongfully taking too much water 17 years before that?	1
340885	So, don't we have to look at what appropriate means in this context?	0
8301852	It's...	1
9062955	And what else could it include?	1
9099407	I mean, that's part of the problem.	1
3640573	Well, I suppose we could say the same thing about Brentwood Academy.	1
1292446	simply...	1
928111	Nonverbal suggestions.	1
6541416	So it serves free speech for the party to spend money on behalf of a candidate without discussing with that candidate the candidate's views and to make sure that the candidate's campaign is the same as the party.	1
8125278	So, the role of the Court is not to establish...	1
5870118	in which...	1
4280511	--and it excluded private schools.	1
6254140	All right.	1
7669242	The Promise Scholarship program practices the plainest form of religious discrimination.	1
4707304	well.	1
8444044	if he...	1
3301662	--Was there some reference to veil-piercing in the respondents' brief in the Ninth Circuit?	1
5096541	You can't get it from a vending machine, in order to protect children.	1
174304	I just still don't understand.	0
4646897	It held that it was a case.	1
7682617	Others say you have an opportunity to show that you're no longer dangerous.	1
1780123	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at ten [= 10] o'clock.	1
1333145	Every claim like that would end up in court under some kind of constitutional analysis.	1
675338	--Well, as we said in our brief, when that situation occurs, courts have upheld stops of up to, you know, 35 minutes, something like that.	0
1813497	Are you making it now?	1
837805	[Laughter]	0
8395519	--that are not contained in table 1.	1
7706667	We submitted that the Court should dismiss as improperly granted, Justice Ginsburg.	1
747934	The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment?	0
7243276	We're not looking to see if they themselves are covered under the ADA in this case.	1
357930	Well, but don't... didn't you have a defendant here without a prior criminal record, and... and the state is trying to prove future dangerousness and that this is a really bad actor.	0
6071306	--Okay.	1
6282363	Now, is that preempted?	1
7983644	The person is still dangerous.	1
2149978	I thought it was 15 to 20, the point Justice Breyer made.	0
567558	outside world?	1
1562020	Well, but does that happen?	1
8446564	Could the State ban adults from receiving advertising of that sort?	1
5657657	I...	1
364450	The --	0
4109236	[Laughter]	1
9150936	there's a difference between assuming it arguendo and conceding it.	1
628715	If you think about questioning -- if the officer starts questions about where the person is going and that kind of thing, you don't -- we don't want officers to have to make finely-tuned judgements in the moment about whether the next question he wants to ask is sufficiently related to the traffic mission or not.	0
3666238	You have a number, and you have the maps.	1
2078110	And the limit there would be twice the amount of any finance charge in connection with it--	1
3669126	Why not?	1
200452	So, the answer is that the State has not paid everything.	0
1872041	And that even if there was a so-called interlocking confession exception, it wasn't met in that case.	0
1570899	Well, exactly.	0
3054463	paragraph fourteen of our complaint.	1
7697580	--I guess we upheld the right of a State to direct that primary... parties have to have a primary election rather than a caucus to select candidates.	1
7999216	and this very case, this person was found to have all kinds of indications of having been planning and perhaps having committed a number of very serious offenses while on probation.	1
6982224	We had not taken as broad a view of the Commerce Clause power as is true today, is that correct?	1
475738	To t- use the sticks...	1
2310627	something.	1
709143	That's right, Your Honor.	0
1023494	--That is correct.	1
6788999	We're bound by what... how California characterizes its own statute I assume.	1
5970834	Will you make a... like a quick summary... I'm asking you repeat yourself, in a sense, but I... Nierotko's a famous case, and Nierotko--	1
6186872	[Laughter]	1
4607998	It says a fiduciary shall not cause the plan to engage in a transaction if he knows--	1
450913	If the legislature were to start with the higher sentence and then say, but if no gun is used, 3 years, otherwise, 5, that ought to be all right.	1
2751211	A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market.	1
6391265	Do you think he has waived any due process claim insofar as it applies to the sentencing?	1
1398288	on wages.	1
2017722	Now, that's what I'd just like to hear you discuss.	1
8938617	I don't, well...	1
2005710	Well, do you defend that as the test?	0
8766370	and coming back and...	1
1260617	I mean, that might be an error...	1
12162	So now the bulk of the earnings are from slot machines rather than the races.	0
3729970	--he's not going to be able to make exactly the same claim later in 2255.	1
8802078	It is...  it is derivatively obtained information.	1
2713151	Who has the burden of proof on the immunity here?	1
3081411	Well, but it's a question of Federal law as to whether that includes a nondischargeability claim.	1
1422900	--Yes.	0
9354545	Yes.	1
2490242	How often are these habeas--	1
5385118	doing the same thing?	1
2251131	Does that distinguish this Erie ordinance from Barnes?	0
8368076	Two more. You have...	1
285473	It wasn't until James that we held that immunity applied to anything except property damage.	1
294281	fund shall be given to an agency,	1
5047752	There's nothing false in the information reported.	1
6158431	large...	1
2799535	So a claimant could submit an appeal without specifying any grounds, and theoretically the Appeals Council will look at the whole record.	1
1735212	--But is there... there's no final judgment there, is there, on the attorney's fees?	1
2311572	Is that correct?	1
2370141	In your view the error was in denying summary judgment on qualified immunity?	0
2204018	don't...	0
2927561	There's a kind of black hole in this case.	1
1491292	The... the trust itself has to provide the means, the... the financial wherewithal to make those repairs.	1
314028	--Well, it's vastly different in terms of results if the firearm is a machinegun, and according to petitioner's counsel the evidence isn't all that clear linking this particular individual with a machinegun, and we don't know if the jury would have been able to make that determination, do we?	0
45875	So...	1
6574936	just a minute here.	1
8238894	that proceeding.	1
6169335	Just brand loyalty, that's all--	1
79874	But it's not recognized in the Federal statute or in the regulations.	0
265734	Or maybe you can come back to it and your cocounsel can try to find it.	0
1671740	Would the Government be without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?	0
119097	--You would accept that argument?	1
8096878	And that is consistent...	1
904321	--and the officer is reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic mission.	0
839111	Does that weigh in the balance at all?	1
6738790	Justice Scalia, Did you have a question?	1
1754553	Well, if I could explain what the reasonableness approach is.	0
7597860	There may be some Privacy Act concerns, but still, this is truthful information.	1
77039	I could ask the same question with just and reasonable rates.	1
1555183	There's no violation unless there's a policy.	1
7715628	If it's complete compensation, then we're back to my problem, which is digging up very old claims from 1780 or something, and we discover that all of the taxpayers of Massachusetts are going to pay $5 billion to New Hampshire because they found a claim from 1782 and there's compound interest.	1
4190012	But -- this...	1
5745219	Well, let's... let's be specific here.	1
9454062	All right, so they're all terms of the contract, so the answer is, you have a claim, you think... or you get the money, they think you don't.	1
3153713	Gee, I didn't think--	1
1874401	So that's it for ozone.	1
5181971	Nothing expressed?	1
375014	I mean  would not execute rocket scientists.	1
8542974	No, I recognize that you're not conceding the... the... the point that a predicate for applying it to the States, even a... a... a non-6-weeks antidiscrimination has been shown, but if we assume that point is past, then is the argument, is the appropriateness of the means somehow categorically different for States from the appropriate... appropriateness of the means with respect to private employment?	1
7762187	That ceased, did it not, the review?	1
878004	Well.	1
2291868	Then that's the exact same intrusion that would occur if the officer decided to do all of the traffic-related tasks first, that took 10 minutes, and then he did a dog sniff immediately afterwards.	0
1669906	All right, now, the language in this particular settlement agreement gave up claims arising out of or relating to the matter of the State court litigation.	1
4611274	we have to be able to show...	1
224515	--It would be permissible for them to do that as long as in each stop, it fell within the reasonable amount of time that -- that it would take for a routine traffic stop if the officer--	0
398340	Justice O'Connor asked the question, suppose the trier of fact found 100 percent of the water, or let's say, 98 percent of the water over the last 10 years in Madera Canal has been for irrigation purposes only, any difference in the case?	1
4410220	You could have sued the prime saying it was wrong to withhold my progress payment?	1
4337821	That's...	1
1845011	saying that...	1
6445319	Mr. Minear, one thing seems to have gotten lost in this discussion.	1
5705399	Yeah, they...	1
6956839	We issue mandates and you're saying that those mandates could be ignored by a state as long as the way in which the state ignores the mandate commends itself to some reasonable juror... reasonable lawyer rather though most reasonable lawyers decide the contrary, is that what you're thinking?	1
8923249	Thank you, Ms. Millett.	1
1001954	I mean, that seemed clear to me from Murray, and what's been omitted is a determination about whether the ineffective assistance claim was procedurally defaulted.	0
4985056	Right.	1
7064328	is just...	1
8414323	Is that what you're--	1
6248181	That's what I want to know.	1
4609406	--What about the psychological reports, Mr. Verrilli?	1
1794653	Is that perfectly okay?	0
8494401	to do it.	1
6893523	And now is there anything else...	1
9450561	Let me ask you. Go ahead.	1
1393583	Do you think Congress can by law establish that the disabled are a discrete minority entitled to heightened scrutiny in reviewing legislation, or action by States?	1
2918607	Excuse me.	1
9299617	Because the --	1
4687886	Okay.	1
7270946	Would you mind telling us just what post-deprivation remedy, if we assume there is some problem here, was open to the respondent subcontractor?	1
1819646	You want us to overrule earlier cases about--	0
270039	No, Your Honor. In fact,	1
4551032	How often are these habeas--	1
1630926	Well, it also says, or by any other means authorized by law, so isn't that the issue?	1
3982453	It appeared to be the assumption that the Oneidas did not have to go to Kansas, if they chose not to do it.	1
7759723	The reason is the following.	1
8061979	You're saying in the later provision it only means one of those two.	1
2772225	entirely excludes section...	1
5778834	Was the authority contested in the Oklahoma Courts from which this case came to us?	1
4009167	I mean, some States don't have legislative history.	1
1918239	that there is.	1
6696058	tips that they may have...	1
3107903	Absolutely, and in -- Because in this...	1
1349280	And the thing that's striking about this procedure is that now you have the two parties to the settlement agreement, the United States and the tribe, coming in and telling us the same story, which is it isn't what you say it is.	0
5466056	derives its basis.	1
2255275	Would if the action were brought as a Bivens action against the employees, do you concede that there would be a Bivens action against them?	0
9077880	allow the Federal circuit...	1
2576317	Well, I'm not sure it is.	1
182851	Well, I guess these points were made in prior litigation efforts, maybe not by Mr. Stephenson, but these points were litigated, were they not?	0
7170708	I haven't heard it.	1
1186409	This comes close because you say it's unconstitutional to proceed with lethal injection under these circumstances.	0
6673187	That was... Shrink, Missouri, involved contribution limits, did it not?	1
1534602	Well, isn't there some room, though, for the argument that it... there may be a business necessity not to hire somebody who's going to be killed as a result?	0
1816725	It is strange to say not only... once you give it to us, you have to give us the best deal.	1
808231	Does the record tell us if there are any private, substantially equivalent league which is... well, any league which is made up of all private schools which is substantially equivalent?	1
2161714	to this...	1
9513145	Right?	1
2023737	What happens?	0
2009850	Well, this Court in that Two Pesos case basically said that we don't apply to a trade dress claim a general requirement of secondary meaning.	0
2514358	Time permitting, I'd like to make three brief points.	1
6747080	Well, there is...  there may be breathing space, especially with respect to the Establishment Clause area, where this Court will not find entanglement or endorsement under certain programs that may not be required, but what this Court has said is that distinguishing...  that discriminating against Catholics and discriminating against people who are religious generally and even people who are anti-religious generally violates the twin components of equality and neutrality that are...  that are mandated by the religion clauses.	1
846665	You're trying to shoehorn it under the rule of evidence category, number four?	0
2273818	In... in the Federal court you think they're routinely appointed by the state?	1
956549	Why isn't... sorry.	1
286718	You don't need all that.	0
4317622	Mr. Sarnowski.	1
5854050	I mean, if your client wanted to go into Tribal Court to enforce it, I wouldn't have thought Montana would be a barrier.	1
2212763	--is not an aggravated felony?	0
1161687	Well, don't take your time to look it up.	0
2099129	--In '52.	0
8765683	In Howey itself the Court...	1
606195	I would think that the problem is what happens to that information later, that everybody in the neighborhood knows it, that they're likely to shun the people, that... that it may be too broad.	1
4525123	Ms. Underwood, we'll hear from you.	1
2369174	You're showing--	1
6501318	Yes, what have they got against hockey?	1
687261	You think...	1
2167774	Very well, Mr. Pescetta.	1
8599203	Well, when they say constitutional right, certainly I take it it would no longer be available to raise a claim under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, that the State court had violated that.	1
254577	Well, without deciding, in some instances, like class certification, without even deciding whether there's subject matter jurisdiction.	0
4665239	Proving the racial motivation was predominant, then you've got to have strict scrutiny to see if it was justifiable and all the rest.	1
1761373	Maybe Congress can leave it to her, you know, to pick a reasonable point.	1
2079622	Would you talk about what the system is here, because I found it a little hard to understand.	1
4265768	How do you analyze it, really?	1
700774	Correct.	1
9491271	Do you defend the approach taken otherwise by the courts below?	1
2229620	But it would certainly be a new exception to the collateral order doctrine, would it not?	0
2799222	Your Honor.	1
8362311	But the fact that you haven't gone to court doesn't seem to me to have any bearing on whether you have a property interest or not.	1
9426081	[Inaudible]	1
2335909	I I...	1
9191133	We have a professional corporation--	1
2410422	Because this is the fear that some of them might be.	1
5319159	So a prisoner who doesn't know how to read and write and who has... whose family has no telephone, what are they supposed to do without a contact visit?	1
7844243	Well, if we'll... if we get over that hurdle and can conclude it doesn't matter, would you enlighten us on one other thing.	1
2318875	--Your claim is an ex post facto claim, a retroactivity claim.	1
8501146	Well, there's no formal restriction on employment, but it... in many of these cases, these people have terrible times renting a place to live, getting a job.	1
4528389	Yes, Justice Ginsburg.	1
237294	No, the record doesn't tell us.	0
1819384	The GFF, which you say is analogous to a forum, and then the...  the student referendum mechanism, and what's the third?	0
1973700	Russello had an earlier section where the more general word was limited.	1
1710064	court.	1
3166782	Because it is a...  it is...	1
1094933	All right.	0
1363568	which requires an answer within so many days. It's simply a heads-up.	1
4413477	How could it have been clearer?	1
660941	You have probably labor relations problems as a result of having somebody put at risk on the job.	0
691853	So what kind of a seniority plan is that? I mean, on the one hand you say, we have to apply our seniority plan, but on the other hand, it isn't enforceable.	0
6355679	Could... could the State require a special mark on your license plate?	1
9255885	The best way to tell what the fair deal was, it seems to me, is to read the text of the statute, and this is phrased as a very broad ban against the States going beyond the electronic media ban that was contained in the statute.	1
646223	You sued the prime?	1
876683	And we don't have before us any conflict preemption under Section 514?	0
4564744	You're telling me that over the last 30 or 40 or 50 years there have been numerous cases in the courts where handicapped and disabled people have routinely made equal protection claims and prevailed?	1
104137	Humphrey Bogart.	1
6522260	I'm saying in your opinion, what does it mean?	1
7277455	I mean, you... you would still have some testimonial statements in there.	1
8365251	strategic decision...	1
1967992	Well, by any theory.	1
7015144	Is that not truthful?	1
3477717	and that's all. And...	1
7684582	The officer was going to a building that the officers thought was the location for a lot of drug trafficking.	1
1599646	Well, no, Your Honor.	0
1849000	Both.	1
8064972	Unless they change their rationale, there is no question, as I understand it, on the basis of this opinion what the result will be.	1
6174532	A spending limit is a spending limit.	1
1209601	Mr. Reynolds, is this a mixed question of fact and law that we're talking about?	1
4238737	extraordinary.	1
2643308	I thought they had been sequestered.	1
3316231	My neighbors know that I've committed a crime, but they don't... the same reaction... the notion that I am being labeled not a convicted offender... which I am... but a sex offender, a current status... a current status with no opportunity to get out.	1
1272117	Don't blame it on me.	1
5798753	That is...	1
1579357	Is that the answer?	1
388616	It seems to me that one things that cuts across all the instructions are the special issues that were given to the jury at the very end and with respect to each of the three special issues, the jury was said in order to say no to that, we the jury because at least ten jurors have a reasonable doubt as to the matter inquired into in this special issue find and determine that the answer... issue is no.	1
410828	I mean, you're saying it's not property.	1
2982940	Well, what do you make of Professor Davenport's proposal to capitalize the contingency fee as a transaction?	1
234690	How could Colorado have known about prejudgment interest in an interstate compact dispute?	1
8102695	conduct-	1
5237404	What...	1
8598359	--of the ordinary rule of finality.	1
2012630	So... and although being a principal is a condition of being a member, a voting member, can a principal decide, I'm not interested in this and I won't do it?	1
9467862	Could you give me a good source?	1
241593	Well, did he have as much of a right as a fellow passenger would have--	0
2875302	easy concept.	1
1944950	We're just going to look at our own.	0
1730749	Perhaps you could point me to where that was addressed.	0
8108254	There are books in California filled with State laws, and anyone could complain about any one of those laws, that they violate the Constitution and, indeed, if you had a law governing court procedure, which you thought was very, very, very unfair, I suppose that might violate the Constitution, too, so sure, maybe this is unconstitutional in that sense, but in that sense, what's unconstitutional about it?	1
2836648	there was a...	1
3191280	So, what is your answer to that?	1
5581692	I take it so much of the... the other side's position here depends on the relationship between the coordinated expenditures and the individual contribution limits to the candidates themselves.	1
2400682	Ms. McDowell, there... there is a section, 9704(f)(2)(B), that deals with annual adjustment of unassigned premiums.	0
1828024	It did so after the petitioner had filed a petition that made reference to some of the cases that address the question whether a signed notice of appeal could be... whether a signing constituted typing.	1
546504	Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire of you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU area, have applied their own disability laws to some of the cruise ships that touch base in their courts?	0
3030045	then what meaning do we give to reasonable accommodation in the ADA?	1
8483645	on for Federal tax pur-	1
7772406	[Laughter]	1
61196	At only reasonable fee can be a contingent fee?	0
288609	In other words, you say seizes the money due, what you mean is, it's a notice that they refuse to pay under their contract with the prime.	1
1556623	And therefore, your claims about how bad this is may be right.	1
9308851	It still does everything the thing does, but under Rule 11 if you didn't sign it, it could be stricken.	1
612383	Will the community start to accept 40-minute stops?	0
7622379	I mean the statute itself refers to that as a cap.	1
557937	What happens if we find for you in this case?	1
3799318	Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.	1
8897020	I thought that's what you were doing.	1
1350373	What you can do -- no, Your Honor, I think -- Mr. Chief Justice, I think you do.	0
4170665	So it is the agency position.	1
919869	In the 15.6 million dollars of non-Federal money that the Republican National Committee spent in the 2001 off-year election, when there were no Federal candidates on the ballot--	1
9101440	I mean, of course, they had a right to copy it.	1
1595873	Well now, I gather that the Ms. Herdrich did recover in a malpractice action in this very case.	0
9622825	--But you're not arguing that the agreement precluded this.	1
7966931	Were those rights still extant in 1985?	1
1348674	And the judge just says the prosecutor's arguments are just that, they're not the law.	0
8374508	I was curious about that.	1
7394812	rejected the notion.	1
4742831	Yes, well, then the Secretary came in and argued and said, yes, her discretion was if it were an act of God or a machine breakdown she would exercise her discretion.	1
5768697	capacity --	1
4197058	Presumably the recent elections were conducted under this scheme that you're challenging.	1
3492621	And then if you win, instead of $4,000, he could take $80,000 through the party.	1
6832420	To take it off and put it back?	1
4995660	Would your answer be the same?	1
5911721	I yes, I believe so, Justice Kennedy, but I'm not sure, a hundred percent sure, factually I know the answer to that.	1
8248509	something...	1
5910171	I don't e-	1
1283556	And was there anything in the affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?	1
6054978	To what extent do we owe deference to the Government's position in this case?	1
9544399	evidence...	1
5818633	--an example of a case in which there would not be immunity.	1
9457741	I don't e-	1
672246	--I thought, frankly, that he had appealed in March of 1996 and AEDPA was enacted in April.	1
1997148	sure that...	1
2131179	And taken some act in furtherance of it?	1
5178183	he did absolutely nothing, then we have to wrestle with whether you divide it from, you know, sentencing phase from guilt innocence phase, and so forth.	1
4557264	You say a statement similar to that was made to each one of the jurors during the voir dire?	1
3537329	But how would you distinguish...	1
7920200	Well, but that, this section 1729 doesn't say that.	1
1034574	Well, why not do the simplest thing?	1
3487348	interpretation does.	1
1232998	I mean, when... when exactly did the injury--	0
3607414	you know...	1
2388367	If we were to do it, which... which version would be the best?	0
5491585	Not only that, you have...	1
1560788	Is there any other effect-- --by virtue of their finding?	1
197051	So shouldn't that, Mr. Draper, mean that there should be some modification?	1
2809117	The investor doesn't care whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return.	1
7250984	I thought what happened here was that the lawyer found no grounds that he thought justified going further, and so advised the California courts, and did not ask to withdraw, and did not point out any so-called arguable issues.	1
2361579	So that much is clear.	1
1302706	Well, but now, Mr. Curry, I thought that a majority of the Federal circuits to have interpreted this very section, (e)(2), have articulated some kind of a fault requirement, if you will, on the part of the defendant.	0
396745	I mean, I assume that.	1
6298558	But often it hinges, when you're talking about immunity it hinges upon factual determinations that can only be found later.	1
8959595	Now, why isn't that part and parcel of the contract then?	1
3650999	--This form says, state the reasons, and leaves blank space to do that.	1
1601124	Now, was there a Rule 59 motion made here after the verdict?	0
384687	Well, the... the language of the statute is pretty strong: unless the government demonstrates that the imposition is the least restrictive means and in furtherance of a compelling legislative interest.	0
971218	It's at...	0
2653168	--When do you--	1
3349701	[Laughter]	1
7076461	Yes.	1
5717623	It doesn't cover the suburbs of Worcester.	1
1406257	It's very vague to me what it is you say the employee has to prove with regard to the availability or lack thereof of employer remedies.	0
9172837	No canvas or solicit --	1
2934094	I assume the Girl Scout meetings are adult sponsored.	1
572866	I think the Florida court has sort of ignored that old Boardman case.	0
967245	The formal test--	0
460150	Well, what if we have the rare case?	0
7548233	Is that because of the notion of accommodation principles?	1
584841	The Congress then was giving away public lands and was giving away public minerals.	1
6725349	fact, here three preceding incidents, as I recall, and a grievance was filed on all of them.	1
9137575	The courts just don't review it.	1
476382	Why not?	0
8653856	What portion is wetland and what portion upland?	1
5838605	Yes.	1
1955930	[Laughter]	1
307252	Yeah.	0
5000008	to u-	1
7727535	I mean, the State could have an interlocutory appeal if it chose to do so, couldn't it?	1
936267	And is there a finding below that medication will... there's a substantial probability he would be restored to competence if there were medication?	1
474667	[Laughter]	1
3497292	Have they ever represented that they did, in fact, comply with the statutes concerning the level of compensation?	1
4126578	Well, it certainly wasn't ruling it out, Justice Scalia.	1
6438558	Well, do you take the position that the state has authority to send its criminal law enforcement officials onto a tribal reservation to carry out state criminal law functions?	1
4915880	What is our test for whether it rises to the level of punishment?	1
1846742	I suppose in the Anders opinion itself there's some indication that we wouldn't preclude other systems that were equally as effective, right?	0
245207	Did you take...	0
4919971	that test not adequate here in your view?	1
2476966	Mr. Anaya, we've gotten pretty far afield, I think, from what we have to resolve in this case, possibly, and there is remaining, as I understand it, a suit by Mr. Hicks against a state official in his individual capacity.	1
1284377	And I think one could make an argument for a different approach.	0
1899799	May I ask also whether it makes any difference in the balance that the Court strikes that the Scouts are a federally chartered institution and that Government entities such as schools and fire departments and police departments and so on sponsor troop units?	0
4024804	If I...	1
1970185	The other portion is a matter of xxx interstate commerce.	1
2361511	can disregard possibly periods of work during that period if the commission is satisfied that this is going to be a permanent impairment.	0
6519804	Yes.	1
750225	lesser included offense.	1
8897559	Yes.	1
6947699	You disagree with that?	1
6784707	Well, yes, it is.	1
3148228	I'm just surprised that California is resisting having such a system.	1
7092518	And in light of Saffle, I... I don't see what you have left going for you on that argument.	1
1259354	I mean, after all, case can mean different things in a different context.	1
3601154	means.	1
5877432	that even if...	1
3971602	Why isn't it perfectly reasonable to look upon these laws this way: Iowa is taxing a business which has nothing but table games at 20 percent on all the table games.	1
3058310	the reverse...	1
7082603	Where in the record do you show that you claim compliance with the matters in dispute here, or where in your brief do you... I didn't know you said it in your brief.	1
3991065	But, you do--	1
1039743	So in addition to not exceeding the sort of heartland of -- of routine traffic stop durations, the officer also has to be reasonably diligent which means that he needs to be focused overall.	0
2669700	under...	1
1054086	Why shouldn't those have been presented in the first instance to the State court?	0
1924488	The what?	0
7300391	Unless the court determines that the relief meets the remedial standard adopted by Congress, that it is narrowly tailored and no greater than necessary, and so forth.	1
2885744	At page 49 and 50 it says, the withholding was adequately pleaded and proven, but I'm not sure that you say that you had complied with the statue.	1
4466365	But your experience...	1
50896	No duty to advise.	0
1071020	And was it complied with here fully, do you think--	0
8208208	Mr.	1
7075515	In the example Justice--	1
1466070	The permit...	1
66902	Now, that's a different question.	1
424176	The social security trust fund, so to speak.	0
4431751	But you do say that this was a single, particular job.	1
4736964	And ever since Oregon v. Elstad, which said it didn't apply to fruits, all the courts of appeals in the Federal circuits, but one, have said it comes in.	1
7805869	Well, the...  the precise lines here, Justice O'Connor, may be difficult in a particular one-on-one investment case.	1
9388970	It is 323... and pardon me because the statute has--	1
682493	In Howey itself the Court...	1
6436840	ar- on the petition?	1
4596616	--Mr. Dreeben, you seem to be... the Government's position seems to be somewhat of a shifting target.	1
2244900	Even though we know on the facts of this case, don't we, that that isn't true, and there's no move made by California to do any allocation.	1
7501672	There is no suggestion that using hard money for I is more corrupting or is corrupting in any way than using hard money for the other.	1
4780717	But couldn't Iowa then say, okay, we're just doing this under Iowa equal protection, and we can make that whatever we want?	1
3456026	precise language, but it contains --	1
1241128	Well, I guess my concern actually is more with the sentencing proceeding here, in light of what's happened, than with the guilty plea.	0
1948100	Yeah. And the Court in Nix made it pretty clear that we assumed there would be a fruits suppression.	0
666848	Then your whole case would collapse.	1
6383843	--But why isn't the evidence that this is... is a face plastered on the Internet, that in modern times that is the equivalent of the town square where you're shaming the bad actor?	1
2067985	That is... if I may just for a moment to expound upon that.	1
311191	In this case, the stated reason I think we assume, at least according to the trial judge's instruction to the jury, was unlawful.	0
9329116	You'd still have to vacate the judgment below, which seemed to go too far in saying that if there is any consumer confusion, that's the end of it.	1
486763	there's nothing...	1
5085266	You don't get the information that this was on the scale of sexual offenses on the lighter side.	1
2106358	Well, do you think that because of the holding in Buckley that it's no longer incumbent upon the State to establish the interest that the State has to support this?	0
3485296	Well, you know, that's why we grant certiorari in cases, because we don't think one... one rule should be... obtained in New York and another rule in New Orleans, but I don't think we ever thought it was the Equal Protection Clause that--	1
5359984	I asked you whether any of them show that it was, in fact, a building or a car or a boat.	1
3389710	It's hard to say the homeowner had abandoned this heat information.	1
713862	Well, I guess you would be content with just relying on whatever was disclosed at the plea colloquy in court.	0
5811912	General Underwood--	1
7953597	And then the state went to federal district court and said, you, federal district court, should decide these issues.	1
9438754	They gave them permission to have these slot machines, which they didn't before, so they're preferring the racetracks by giving them this, but they say not too much because we're going to let you make money from these slot machines, but not too much.	1
1002470	They are designed to protect people that put their money in the hands of other people who are running business...  businesses...  and from whom they expect to make a return.	1
1305782	Well, what if we have the rare case?	0
3381397	Now, when we look at those days, we get maybe... I don't know how many days per year, but not all that many, and maybe one every 3 years or something, but let's say it's 100 days a year.	1
8703729	Right.	1
8611828	And as for CASAC and the parties not favoring going below what you finally picked, I mean, that can be explained because they, unlike, unlike EPA, may have been taking economic effects into account.	1
3634773	Is it an as-applied challenge, of some kind?	1
8713430	Yes.	1
7676700	Sure.	1
7789866	In fact, do you have even any right... as far as I can see, what he's complaining about in the State criminal process is a deprivation of constitutional rights.	1
5498158	[Inaudible]	1
1718966	So is getting behind a wheel when you're drunk and turning on the keys.	0
6782522	Where do I look to find if that's so or not?	1
210042	The Sacramento River waters couldn't go to the San Joaquin if the Friant didn't back... didn't stop the natural tributary.	1
1979782	And I think they have determined for the time being...	0
2267681	So is it a step to say they can implicitly agree the same thing?	1
3069602	Yes.	1
1780607	So we are talking about the first degree burglary--	0
5867303	I understand.	1
9377945	that. Or --	1
687484	Well, I... it doesn't say that.	0
4630141	For the race, there's a great disparity between the parimutuels.	1
9611240	We don't... we don't have the figures on that.	1
3003127	I read your brief.	1
4329308	where I am. But...	1
1166610	--by way of a defense.	0
7939671	--but... but I don't think you carry the day on that point.	1
2482411	Has Illinois showed no interest at all or concern about this particular site?	1
4359454	Thank you, Your Honor.	1
7758245	Yes.	1
4075937	All right.	1
8998566	prac-	1
9346091	[Laughter]	1
2072602	Under the statute, I mean, that's your position under the statute, isn't it?	1
1047228	[Inaudible]	1
1663384	Well, Your Honor, I would respectfully disagree.	1
3356251	Whom does the notice to withhold go?	1
1226330	Do we send it back...	0
450000	advisory...	1
6471786	If it's a direct donation to a state candidate, if it is a Get Out the Vote phone bank that advocates that the voters go to the poll and vote for the governor, if it is a mailing, as under the California... as the California party affidavits of Ms. Bowler and Mr. Irwin indicate, that they send--	1
6327421	But it isn't passive because you have a lifetime obligation to update it.	1
2337974	here's the thing.	1
7554153	And this wouldn't be an unusual district if other states linked their major cities with a ribbon in between to make it contiguous?	1
2216745	Don't you.	1
5612989	And when you put all those together, where do you go?	1
2943928	change?	1
2075806	specific...	1
1458040	Where does that interest stem from?	1
971807	Absolutely.	1
7338778	But the main coach, even in the private school, would have to be a full-time employee?	1
1846083	Well, I guess these points were made in prior litigation efforts, maybe not by Mr. Stephenson, but these points were litigated, were they not?	0
5644629	that there's a consensus and want to argue it's just not enduring? Or what is it you're...	1
1274738	Well, it was filed before a responsive pleading--	0
1803988	Your Honor. We have in this particular case...	1
8484459	I don't see why the jury gets into this at all.	1
8782790	Well, isn't part of the answer that it allows release from the Sacramento into the San Joaquin, which--	1
9387360	Congress...	1
3923162	[Laughter]	1
7022817	Los Angeles was concerned...	1
9564770	using...	1
1963386	Should we apply Arkansas Electric and say that's binding?	0
8979862	phase.	1
2566592	Is that... that was the problem the court had below.	1
9317379	It sounds like coordination to me.	1
1560431	And I think the reason it said generally was because some of those provisions do not deal with the initial substantive requirements for getting relief, but deal to such matters as what are the conditions for appeal.	1
1054217	If he had, himself, shredded the documents, or destroyed them, that was perfectly okay at the time it was done.	1
174879	Maybe I'm not reading it right--	0
3488951	So if it's easier to use race, we'll just use race, just save ourselves all the trouble.	1
8868765	Well, by implication McNally seemed to assume that it was... the statute covers only money or property obtained from the victim.	1
246398	--Ms. Bohr, at the Appeals Council level?	0
7155350	And he talked to all of them and talked to the defendant as well.	1
1577982	contrary one...	0
4657980	those two.	1
143310	Why shouldn't the federal court have decided these issues of immunity of the officers when it had the case before it?	1
1502017	Is that possible?	0
147033	I thought that perhaps since they didn't think the first statement posed a problem that they never really got to the crux of the jailhouse inquiry.	0
3367876	And it is, I think, somewhat unusual that in the strange circumstances of their disappearance, that there wouldn't be some small amount of time given to find out what had happened.	1
1313913	And what has happened to this... to Mr. Johnson since the Sixth Circuit decision?	0
26401	And was it argued at that hearing by the State that Stumpf was the triggerman?	0
7881046	I can't imagine why... well, in my... in... I think he told us first of all in most cases it means nothing at all.	1
5622032	very...	1
6898792	Why isn't it a sensible distinction to draw?	1
5926323	So what about your...	1
7298369	are you re-	1
6845936	Why does it matter?	1
7439509	thirty-one twenty-one A. Thirty-one...	1
8578569	Specificity in what respect?	1
1018612	Under law 280.	1
2085347	But then you're saying it has to be Federal authority, the FTC, and the FDA, at the time they thought they might regulate nicotine as a drug--	1
6427119	I mean, your...  your brief and your presentation certainly urges us to go that route.	1
1129639	But you said they couldn't do that on remand.	1
2435794	penalty.	1
587663	The tax is measured by the wages they pay or are deemed to have paid their employees.	0
87040	That there's nothing in the record to show that.	0
2257072	Where are we?	1
8367273	Is that what you're--	1
4974472	Well, we're reviewing a Ninth Circuit holding, which seems fairly open-ended.	1
5587295	Now, the states have not worked their way through that.	1
551243	So purely as an accounting...	1
1978472	But in the real world I'm wondering how this mistake... who caught it?	1
2847796	You say they won't arise because the tribe now agrees, but they might change their mind.	1
7924945	I think the Solicitor General's response to that, if I understand the briefs, is that, in effect, is the decision that Congress reserved to itself by periodically taking up the question of revising implementation standards as it has, as we are going to get to, I guess, in the next case.	1
3933743	they have this --	1
8399380	and coming back and...	1
3532521	It wasn't even decided in--	1
2306435	I'll instruct you.	0
359601	That was a broad categorical rule.	0
8393983	The position of the Government in... in saying that any misuse by any guest, whether on or off the premises, will result in a forfeiture does seem to operate in a rather draconian fashion in some of the examples we've been given in the briefs.	1
283673	You have to put out pleadings that make clear what your theory is--	0
997454	Okay.	0
6364309	This is far removed from that.	1
2435936	And I don't know how far that would take us if we--	1
9626880	Take his hypothetical.	1
6751624	If that's--	1
893266	--from the evidence?	0
7878279	Abandonment.	1
7778758	Your brief reads to me... at about page 15... to suggest that you're proposing a broad rule that probable cause exists to arrest all occupants of a car anytime commercial quantities of narcotics are found in the passenger portion of the car.	1
567586	No.	0
1161111	I'm not... I don't know the answer to that, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
3980436	And the indications were that at least then Secretary of Commerce Hoover thought employees shouldn't be covered at all, and he presented language to the Congress which approved it, and yet you want us to say that Congress did intend to include for arbitration contracts of employment over which the jurisdiction was most questionable, and yet exclude it for those where the jurisdiction of Congress was clearest at the time, which seems a little odd to me.	1
5888485	Perhaps, but that isn't what Congress did here, Justice Breyer.	1
6168082	Do you... do you think that any other provisions of the Communications Act are enforceable under 1983?	1
1812588	It has nothing to do with common law versus legislation, does it?	1
4003755	Well, if there are 35 buildings on the premises, how many did the Government use since 1960?	1
3493197	been pretty much abandoned.	1
794561	Yes.	1
6287978	No, no.	1
664631	As far as as...	0
2211940	They're... they're different businesses.	1
2066973	May I ask you on that question... I understand they haven't done it, but is there an administrative procedure in which they could have said, here are our books, take a look at it, and we've done everything we're supposed to do, or do they have to sue?	1
7862855	why restaurants -- every employer should hire...	1
1874404	Yes.	0
3188240	If it's--	1
4115411	Even though it was released for irrigation purposes?	1
4477063	Because as I understood it, the criticism was that he concentrated only on the fringe districts and not the core, but I thought it was the fringe districts that were the problem here.	1
763031	And it's hard to know from your argument the answer to that.	0
9243205	If I may --	1
7695931	in all cases of mental illness as well?	1
3314662	What page?	1
8977347	[Laughter]	1
896171	And do you have any case supporting that proposition?	0
8491755	Here, because there's no give, it does have a punitive feel.	1
5755861	No--	1
1197045	[Laughter]	1
1537627	Well, it might make it necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't any.	1
2808669	for it.	1
8687769	That's a pretty low IQ in this case, is it not?	1
5334910	How could Colorado have known about prejudgment interest in an interstate compact dispute?	1
198276	He can't...	1
7746660	to plead  or innocent people to plead guilty? It's crazy.	1
1508041	I take it the problem here is he wasn't given a chance to sign it.	1
6489468	Right.	1
6887924	Yes, I understand that.	1
3019782	when service is to...	1
996564	Right?	0
4364019	That is Levin money.	1
5574279	[Laughter]	1
5787823	criminal law.	1
627463	I... you're just--	1
4292740	Can I ask a clarifying question?	1
59195	Well, I don't think we created a fourth question under Texas statutory law.	1
1136724	Suppose...	1
574459	And the underlying goal of the Ex Post Facto Clause you think is served by adopting your position here?	0
5355039	--I think the kick of the gas tank or the tapping showed it was full, not hollow.	1
6632123	does.	1
6236888	we...	1
4301257	I didn't catch the last word, Mr.... are what?	1
8374791	I know you did.	1
8433672	Well, the rule--	1
191707	And I find it very difficult to understand how appellate review could be applied to such a scheme.	1
8965788	we...	1
597358	It didn't just enter a stay order, as would typically be the case.	0
8634675	Let's talk about the standard of the scope of review under the statute, 706, which says that under the APA the reviewing court will hold unlawful agency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law, subsection (A).	1
4082000	Do you know...	1
9475222	nothing in that...	1
5619470	The things below here are not so bad.	1
2436261	Now, was there some change as of 1992 in connection with the fee applicable here?	1
2498243	Is that okay?	1
9629381	But can I...	1
4365870	I think your client asked for summary judgment at the trial court level.	1
2236297	Well, Congress did want patent law to be uniform, didn't it?	0
3737400	Now, it sounds to me when you say all those things that you're really saying, can't settle a class action.	1
1006727	"Is that what would be applied if we had to address the consequence here, of holding it to be a ""weighing"" State?"	0
8410787	What do we do about that?	1
7347051	So if it's easier to use race, we'll just use race, just save ourselves all the trouble.	1
7369457	But they won't make the same decision.	1
8692334	Do we apply the same test?	1
4659885	Counsel, would... would the new Dastar video qualify as a derivative work that would deserve copyright protection on its own?	1
9101828	Nowhere in that does it say that you actually have to sign.	1
6988343	If it were different... if, for example... some counties around the country don't prosecute on cases like this, or maybe the quantity would have to be a little smaller.	1
5862996	Why would it not be wiser for us to say, just to keep the systems running smoothly, look, we are not going to be bound by State court determinations of legislative intent or purpose?	1
8401218	[Inaudible]	1
319366	It's a little odd in this Pittman Act because it... it does in section 8 refer to valuable minerals, but at various other times in the act, it just says minerals.	0
3893974	--than the Ninth Circuit gave it credit for.	1
2164377	Is that your position?	1
6068581	There's simply no...	1
4386493	In the past.	1
2182045	What if the rules were changed so that to be a delegate you didn't have to be a principal, that you were just a parent from the school in question, so there's a representative from each one of the schools?	1
802	And the judge just says the prosecutor's arguments are just that, they're not the law.	0
5400739	Rather than getting into all that, why wouldn't we assume that the States didn't want to unless they said it specifically in the compact?	1
9443689	in this case.   Yes.	1
7308723	that's actually...	1
6585521	categorization on the w- with your precise number...	1
470059	If there's something different about this one, it must stem from the fact that in a very old case what we're talking about are two groups of taxpayers, neither of whom was around at the time, shifting money between each other and stirring up a lot of trouble between their States.	1
5299662	And let me ask you, is it often that roadblocks are set up just to get information like this?	1
5785259	took refers...	1
5722569	In general, what contractors will go into this kind of thing with your fine spun arguments being used against them?	1
1919316	But under--	0
7496942	correct.	1
8884771	Then the argument is that Congress has reserved something and it shouldn't have reserved it.	1
611254	Is that enough?	1
955411	That the employer had no remedial scheme in place or what is it?	0
358268	--as 15 to 20.	0
2757227	Well, yes, it is.	1
334336	Yes, we did.	1
257495	I just didn't know how that worked.	0
8157387	Sure.	1
5360259	And is all of that land practicably irrigable as the...  the cases deal with that term, all 25,000 acres, or some smaller portion of it?	1
951894	Propeller guard?	0
8152248	Well, it may be an unusual way, unless we are going to allow your theory of immunity to become a plenary theory in which there will never be liability, isn't that what we're going to have to do?	1
9357697	Weren't... weren't there some other questions here, like didn't we grant cert on three questions--	1
6413083	I understand.	1
2626989	What's the authority for the burden of proof question?	1
982417	Mr. Cockrill, we'll hear from you.	1
3364338	So your point is that's all we have to decide, whether the fact that it's a fixed return excludes it from the definition of a security?	1
3163216	But you think that's not sufficient?	1
2139646	Well, if we were to conclude that there was a violation of the so-called deliberate elicitation standard, modified or not, then what, with regard to the subsequent conversation of the jail, after the warnings had been given?	0
2063448	Is there any special call made, or is the credit card just submitted to the store and the store processes it and if it's not rejected, it goes through?	0
3189604	So I suppose... if we were to agree with you on the first statement and conclude they were deliberately elicited, we'd have to remand, I suppose--	1
373232	That...  well, that's correct, Your Honor.	0
7220047	Absolutely.	1
1822425	At least, certainly when I practiced law you did.	1
8136962	says.	1
2543941	Even though it was released for irrigation purposes?	1
2570740	You said Ohio is now attainment area.	1
7839960	What the Congress in 1909 and 1910 intended.	1
2816341	Is that constitutional?	1
1532902	Was a FOIA claim open to the respondent here? Could could such information have been sought and obtained theoretically under FOIA?	0
2222103	And why doesn't section 1226 tell the courts to keep hands off?	0
18141	in this way.	1
464346	Yes, Your Honor.	0
6350871	do anything. It's not like a complaint.	1
4683470	There is one exception...	1
3149638	or do they have to...	1
4345011	--That's right, broader.	1
2757645	If, as you say, the... the intent of the legislature is the criterion, why didn't you ask them, why did you vote the way you did?	1
3303412	If you think gender discrimination cases aren't different, you're just wrong.	1
5753186	--Well, in order to ameliorate that possibility, Justice Souter, the Seventh Circuit, for example, has adopted a standard under which it will not decide a claim of ineffectiveness in the defendant's favor unless there's no possible strategic rationale for counsel's decision and, of course, to the extent that there may be a strategic rationale for the counsel's decision, it'll be in the Government's interest to bring that to the court's attention in its appellate briefing, and we haven't seen too many situations in which a court grants a claim of ineffectiveness on direct appeal, but yet there was potentially a strategic rationale for counsel's decision.	1
6363044	Is that still before us?	1
4240900	There must have been some procedure that you were availing yourself of under State law and State court.	1
8866674	Maybe they thought the signature requirement was there but non-jurisdictional.	1
5027169	I I...	1
1271649	[Laughter]	1
3299902	Under what section?	1
2507200	Are there situations where the city or town is particularly aware of traffic problems within the city or a weak bridge or something and that its limitations are needed?	1
6069573	So those funding cases are completely distinguishable...	1
7550834	Would it affect--	1
2664768	--that use the term public health, and then add to the term public health the impact upon the economy.	1
2543017	I just thought it was a little curious that if some means of solving this had been offered, why we're here.	1
656725	Have your...	1
4108364	your brief?	1
5966266	enforcement --	1
4686481	Well, what... how do you read that in coordination with the so-called safe-harbor provision for legal advice and so on?	1
1188135	--some drug-related offense?	0
5444494	We do...	1
2123518	Yeah.	0
355673	Well, apparently that was done.	0
2144409	Right.	1
8654620	drug...	1
6397222	Why don't you simply say that all that Lindh held was that the substantive requirements are governed by a nonretroactive principle, and what nonretroactivity means for the substantive requirements is that you apply them to all cases.	1
5734833	Well, certainly you could, but I would think there would a difference in the kind of squeezing and manipulation that would occur to identify objects within a bag than would occur normally when you just move it to make more room for your own.	1
7389538	Mr.	1
6621967	The burden, of course, is...	1
2117811	I mean, we don't... I don't have a sense for whether it matters.	0
5137169	so that's...	1
1211186	What is your...	1
4868333	But there would be...	1
161210	It's hard to say what claim the Petitioner is making.	0
2221463	question...	1
3504811	large...	1
3456958	I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.	1
4559183	Yes, well, we reserved the answer to the question in TLO, whether it would be the same answer if law enforcement were involved.	1
2200242	I mean, it's very confusing.	0
5883660	We know somebody has filed a notice of appeal, but--	1
869788	And if so, what is it?	0
3714316	That allegation has not been made before, has it?	1
7832829	What possible interest would the prison have in prohibiting... assuming you allowed an inmate to provide legal services to another, which sometimes I understand happens, what interest of the prison is there in making sure that it is never done in written form, which the prison can then read?	1
2996017	Justice Breyer, there are situations in which ineffectiveness claims can be raised and resolved on direct appeal, and--	1
4047010	suspicion?	1
968185	And what has happened to this... to Mr. Johnson since the Sixth Circuit decision?	0
1161291	They should be subject to--	0
966557	That's right, Your Honor.	0
3526000	The MSPB --	1
2265322	Well, what event triggers, if you will, the incidence of the tax on the distributor?	1
3379251	But, the standard forum selection clause?	1
5338545	I have some difficulty in adopting a test that this is an irrigation facility.	1
1877649	It is squarely inconsistent with the notion of a broad, flexible, remedial purpose of the securities statutes.	1
2477357	It's here.	1
5483612	Do you--	1
6331968	--Percutaneous.	1
7129913	basically correct?	1
1168588	But that gets me back to my question.	0
6635990	Mm-hmm.	1
854819	And what did they reveal in this area of mitigation?	1
4732993	[Inaudible]	1
4402178	in rule eleven itself that says you cannot look beyond the transcript of the plea hearing itself?	1
3663073	Court, Your Honor.	1
1432539	--is not an aggravated felony?	0
1451451	Wouldn't you like to see it if it went against you?	1
4057544	It was a week later?	1
3375566	But you... you don't seem to mention our holding in Saffle v. Parks which was a much harder, closer case in my view about whether it was dictated by Lockett than your case.	1
6439284	I want to make sure we're together at least on one point.	1
2054403	Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you suppose?	0
3769917	We've been very insistent that you can't keep it away from adults, although a lot of people think it's addictive and harmful.	1
370334	in the statute...	0
498633	Now, let me ask you this.	0
3427438	And and that the Ninth Circuit felt that because this was a constitutional right that the defendant was h- had that was being withheld from the defendant because of the of the circumstances of this case, that the the district court erroneously presumed that it was prevented from going in a in a in a direction that the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go.	1
3202725	Government re- deprive the prisoner of any benefits or programs if he refuses to e- engage in the program? The the Federal Government doesn't apply the same in- incentive schemes that the State of...	1
5270600	Are... are there separate questions?	1
1681063	Thank you.	0
6071512	a...	1
9288994	--and protects the miner of the hard coal.	1
9566248	Does it show it was a vehicle?	1
3623429	I mean, there is no Iowa law pertaining to slot machines in particular.	1
4153716	Well, but precisely, but that... that shows that there's an added burden here that was added by the State after the conviction.	1
2263015	Thank you.	0
2189649	--Does it depend in part on how we define functionality under the trade dress inquiry?	0
2419180	and the like.	1
785796	--Do you think this was interlocking?	0
9210189	If the entire political process at the state level is subjected to the hard money limits, you're right, Your Honor.	1
1404865	--all we're doing is looking at the statute.	0
8839287	it different...	1
9361018	trick-or-treaters? Do they have to go get a permit?	1
9186751	provision. You can tell by the...	1
6724807	Small compared to the 18 acres.	1
2112977	tenancy by the entirety. It's the marriage that sells it.	1
577675	And we don't have before us any conflict preemption under Section 514?	0
3241192	--I'd like to ask a question, which is these have been very interesting hypotheticals, but are you going to have time to talk about the questions that we granted cert on?	1
2396731	--until the time the suit is filed--	0
575454	Not talking about general limits on contributions?	1
7637198	Does it show it was a vehicle?	1
7353407	[Laughter]	1
1789506	Once the stop is done, once the purpose is done, the justification is done, the person should be free to go.	0
9312322	You mean, this isn't based on smoking and health?	1
5113422	How can they do that?	1
754855	under under manual tasks?	1
223708	Thank you, Mr. Stein.	1
4127244	They can.	1
1271255	[Laughter]	1
5959313	Isn't the difficulty in this case that what you describe as the structure is in effect an instruction that says you may act irrationally and as against that possibility there were at least two avenues open to the court that would have allowed the jury to do just what Penry One required and to do it in a rational way?	1
2299675	That... Justice Breyer, it's correct that it saves time at the stage of collateral review, but the question for procedural default purposes is the effect of the rule at the time of direct appeal, and--	1
832037	Well, what about someone who is truly a dangerous sex offender, who poses a real risk to children in that area?	1
2626970	Nobody went back and said, hey, we don't need this now?	1
7420139	It is squarely inconsistent with the notion of a broad, flexible, remedial purpose of the securities statutes.	1
5357770	Well, Mr. Clement, the... I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context.	1
8906356	Not as to a Federal officer, correct.	1
228403	That is correct, Your Honor.	0
7275414	No, but what I'm saying is, once you allow that, doesn't that have the same corruptive effect as what you're trying to prohibit?	1
4025615	N- n-	1
265676	How are we supposed to decide what's reasonable in California?	0
9349727	I think that this Court has...	1
8306727	Your Honor, I think the Court put it well in Siebold over a century ago when it said, for those activities that had exclusive reference to a state election, the Federal government has no role.	1
465487	It alters the amount of evidence necessary for conviction.	1
1186467	Now, normally we would just defer to that, wouldn't we, and move on to the merits.	0
96033	--I think that's right, but as other members of the Court have suggested, once there's probable cause to stop someone for--	0
697756	And normally we apply strict scrutiny.	0
6440475	Every regulatory measure that goes too far is... is not criminal punishment.	1
7429515	What I was about to say is that to the extent that you change the requirement and allow it to be speculative, the more speculative you can be, the less likely you're required to comply with the securities laws.	1
6239461	Mr. Miller... General Miller, you have four--	1
8552820	Judge...	1
301827	Is that right?	0
4866853	Did you address, on behalf of Stumpf, some allegation that he has to be resentenced?	1
5079319	I'm not a hundred percent sure that's true.	1
1849358	Is that a problem?	0
7642194	Both of those in turn refer to at least state court and in the American Arbitration Association to state or federal court.	1
4250739	factual record...	1
5972290	Even if you sue him in a contract action in California, and you prove what you have represented to us you could prove, i.e., that you performed everything you were obligated to perform, including paying the prevailing wage, even though the findings were that you had proven all of that, the prime contractor still would not be liable to you under the contract, because it was engaged in a dispute with the State?	1
820493	I mean, it... it seems almost that general.	1
5682800	If e- e- e-	1
671677	Well, it seemed to be driven by its very narrow focus on generic drug development.	1
796246	So is getting behind a wheel when you're drunk and turning on the keys.	0
9479202	Prisons has...	1
3473053	Well, that's not true.	1
5354566	Doesn't this statutory language leave that open?	1
9220273	The first half he says is that you look to see whether the underlying claim is a substantial showing of a denial of a constitutional right, but, he says, if the procedural ruling was, you know, rolling off a log, there's no doubt about its correctness, you don't get a certificate of appealability.	1
2260230	This case is about the authority of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assess FICA taxes that Congress has imposed on employers.	0
701608	Could we talk about that?	1
104974	Do you agree with--	1
7196682	think that the practice around the country of various towns and cities is to require permits for people to go door to door in residential areas? I think I even live in a community that probably does that.	1
4464507	[Laughter]	1
6376820	I mean, that puts it a little kindly, don't you think?	1
1207972	It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market.	1
710473	--That's right, the officer can do that.	0
4069330	using...	1
335707	--That's controverted.	1
266801	Okay.	0
6597481	It could be a waiver of sovereign immunity pursuant in the state's own courts?	1
1334212	Otherwise, it is done.	0
1897552	An immediate arrest would have I think been more of a personal intrusion.	1
3135372	I thought they were given a flyer saying if you...  read this and see if you observed anything that could help us find the hit-and-run driver.	1
6496979	That would not be punitive.	1
7029155	Was there any cross examination of witnesses conducted?	1
2746918	[Laughter]	1
6152390	If it's--	1
5500868	and that's all. And...	1
1862170	And the magistrate had a question as to the credibility of this witness, and if you have a question as to the credibility of the witness then there is not sufficient facts to able to make a determination as to whether in fact there is probable cause.	0
818104	Mr. Draper, could I come back to Justice Souter's question?	1
1655457	four twenty-three A...	1
6449891	But then... then you might--	1
1707924	I mean, there are situations in cases -- we cited this in Footnote 20 of our brief where you have the dog arriving just as the officer is about to give the ticket.	0
5260026	Well, how would...	1
210338	--Yes, Your Honor, that would -- that would.	0
8332411	And therefore, why isn't the appropriate action for you to take, to go back to FERC and say, the number they're claiming under your authority is the wrong number, tell them it's the wrong number?	1
7054712	Now, this may not be...	1
8565908	That's flatly inconsistent with the command in the special issue that because at least ten jurors have a reasonable doubt we must answer no.	1
634402	Well, this statute requires you to make the government's message four times a year.	1
4305071	[Laughter]	1
1572685	I'm asking you what your answer to Justice Ginsburg was, whether you didn't agree whether it was a deceptive contract?	1
5204518	I mean, it's inconceivable to me that they try to run up the number just to run up the number.	1
1498798	Well, do you defend that as the test?	0
784806	But the third question that you raised was... apparently did not incorporate any consideration of the Brecht standard.	0
8128011	Well, Your Honor, bear in mind that the Levin Amendment restricts not just Joe Wealthy's... sending Joe Wealthy's donation.	1
694566	So under your test that's out, too, but we've upheld some of those.	0
3226788	it...	1
8651985	Did the Secretary consider alternatives?	1
2389831	Okay.  Now, what do we...	1
2370769	I mean, it just seems odd whether the delay... call the delay undue or not, the fact is there was a 17 or 18-year delay from the time at which Kansas could have brought this lawsuit.	1
6170157	disciplinary actions...	1
4475849	Is that your position?	1
2455390	--if you, if you, if your clients here had been given the review that has been described to us in the government's brief, by military authorities to determine whether these people are indeed being held as enemy combatants, would you be here if you knew that that review had been provided?	1
1371897	Now, let me ask you this.	0
320905	And it intended fact finding by a preponderance for both upward adjustments and downward.	0

8482037	This issue?	1
7241973	that it did start around nineteen ninety-two and nineteen ninety-three, and the information that the IRS is gathering on the forms eighty twenty-seven demonstrated the extent of the problem that Congress suspected did exist about substantial underreporting of tip income.	1
963638	all right.	0
7656465	Well, it was suggested in Segura, I guess, as a possible rule.	1
3089912	to say that was compulsion.	1
5720945	Right.	1
3650115	Why is that?	1
1926724	--Well, are you asking us, counsel, to just focus on the bird habitat final rule or to focus on the regulation in 33 Code of Federal Regulations, section 3328.3, defining waters of the United States?	0
2485358	These were customers of a securities firm?	1
2393153	Don't you think this Court would have the power of review and to issue rulings on what the law is so that it would be uniform?	0
1274435	Well, I suppose we don't have to answer all the questions here if we were to find that the interest offset is unconstitutional because it taxes income over which California lacks jurisdiction to tax.	0
7625166	Well, can you sustain a proposition that the facility that should be examined is the Madera Canal in this case?	1
519555	Certainly the Restatement and the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on this.	0
2170638	Right.	0
1839059	It's not alleged, and that's not the basis of it.	0
1839058	Would it be all right to have the person report every 90 days to have a determination of present dangerousness?	1
5665965	All right.	1
1333548	why the government...	1
6476519	So all right, all right, it says we really, really, really will strike it unless you sign it.	1
8170752	I presume...	1
5483149	That's that's...	1
4855648	But certainly that's what you're arguing.	1
2742797	at that time.	1
5589148	I was curious about that.	1
7928363	and...	1
7088221	I know that the Torres establishes law, but I don't know that any of the others say that you can't cure a defect.	1
3467114	this country.	1
1219283	district court or...	1
212650	Perhaps.	0
6812443	Well, they have a physician's exam and report.	1
522858	Is this the type of statute that... that depends largely on private enforcement to implement it?	0
1038970	The State is simply making a statement that there was a conviction in the past.	1
1783106	Why... why isn't there still an inadequate assistance of counsel claim out there, and why shouldn't the court address that before it gets into the question that it dealt with?	0
2529767	Is that the answer?	1
8054311	the listing...	1
7019787	I... I don't know that viewing it through the lens of a constructive discharge is helpful.	1
6636310	not do so.	1
457705	And what is it here?	0
1880238	Well, if you say that the world we look at is the people using these programs under the Federal law requirements in libraries, then it isn't a public forum.	0
8815591	I think that's just contrary to normal usage.	1
145446	Or do you take the position that they're free to impose shackles in every case, even a traffic offense, if the prosecutor wishes to do it, without any justification?	0
380933	I mean, we're talking about 332, but it's a big, complicated act.	1
5964388	It doesn't say that has to exhaust the grounds on which you are appealing.	1
7850766	"""if you find there any mitigating circumstances in this case. """	1
5035644	No, no.	1
123603	But, this contract does refer to application of the rules of the American Arbitration Association and it makes some reference to the state act.	1
7821958	this...	1
2391405	I would like to know.	1
66821	Right?	0
8147013	They didn't violate that section, did they?	1
923282	But I thought you had assumed that, under the Arizona law, you could rely on the Good Samaritan doctrine--	0
8863424	Can you in one sentence tell me what standard it is you would say public health incorporates?	1
2236821	Yes.	0
557704	The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth Circuit went another.	0
949195	And you take the position that if you just sell 18 percent of the merchandise is adult, then it doesn't qualify?	1
8066030	--as part of its required consideration of factors in setting?	1
5777929	Yeah, but who would have thought that the legislature was leaving open the date for change by the court?	1
125219	operated as a single store, a single business.	1
2044152	Page twelve of the joint appendix.	1
7305863	And I would have thought it was a much more general proposition, that if the Coast Guard adopted some general regulations in this area, that's enough, and that you wouldn't look to see how closely OSHA's regs matched in every detail the Coast Guard regs.	1
6761048	Mr. Short, did that subject jurisdiction come up when you were in the court of appeals?	1
299124	Well--	0
2085171	Any different result?	0
3708002	I mean, usually these things are done for the self-interest of... of legislators from various districts, and... and as long as there could be a rational... I... I would have... I'm surprised it took you so long to answer that question.	1
7461100	You couldn't belong to one State, because it covered all the States.	1
1564934	Well.	1
8815785	is...	1
8920159	Right.	1
417628	Well, Your Honor, sentencing issues are usually addressed in a plea negotiations, so there usually are not...	0
3361363	So--	1
5556358	Cons-	1
2117853	Is that correct?	1
995666	In this one context, not when courts review laws generally for general elections, but in the context of selection of presidential electors, isn't there a big red flag up there, watch out?	0
881645	Well, this... this business of having a court recharacterize a motion as a 2255 motion was a doctrine that seems to have been developed before AEDPA was enacted, and some circuits since the enactment of AEDPA have decided that if they're going... if the district court is going to do that, that some notice should be given, certainly to a pro se petitioner, about the consequences of that recharacterization.	0
2598646	That seems to me just completely contrary to the whole idea of the truth that the First Amendment is designed to vindicate.	1
6618507	what happens if he refuses? Is he put in a different type of confinement with different terms and conditions?	1
9253854	Would that change the case?	1
9843	But the Iowa... the Iowa Supreme Court seems to think it could look to what was the real purpose, not the purpose that we could conceive.	1
1191037	On that s- wait...	1
1468659	We had a context there where we supported it, but in the process said the sniff, the dog sniff, was not a search.	0
2087819	It didn't say it in... it said prompt judicial review, whatever that meant.	1
4382823	I absolutely do, I absolutely do.	1
8263114	There are words, in any court.	1
6109411	Can you question the people you suspect of welfare fraud and ask them how much they earned, if anything?	1
7892628	--Stay means nothing but not go forward with.	1
6707464	person is, and what are they going --	1
2870320	What in that case, what statute were we interpreting?	1
9692	Let the judge do it?	1
6113824	If I...	1
2791991	procedure is played out.	1
209425	--Mr. Sutton, you reach an interesting conclusion if you put together the first and the second parts of your argument.	1
7406928	It doesn't have the implication that it's a waiver only as to Tribal Courts.	1
9065070	There would be immunity there?	1
6234791	reporting on a monthly basis, and in this case there was clearly you know, we have a hundred and twenty thousand dollars of unreported credit card tips in each of the two years involved here.	1
9189015	--Okay.	1
2115492	It might be useful to say they were wrong in--	1
8570721	Well, if you drew the line at the mechanics of awarding, I can understand your concern.	1
608389	Well, I guess we have held, though, several times that Congress meant to define very broadly when it enacted felon in possession of firearm statutes.	0
4406713	Are we bound by that determination?	1
4796534	would have...	1
6929735	Suppose I think they're right.	1
2194291	I mean, why is this worse than those?	1
3375936	I believe that would be unconstitutional, Your Honor.	1
6341238	Are there parochial schools that are members of this association?	1
2217986	person who's been convicted?	1
1731275	They should be subject to--	0
1068743	I'm...	1
533131	Isn't he also going to have to pay the sub in this case if the State is wrong?	1
9361538	Why not?	1
1557906	i-	1
8276815	things that you...	1
6961947	appropriate punishment.	1
171900	Well, i- the taxpayer is in a business that requires a lot of things.	0
8160649	Yes, Justice Ginsburg.	1
6211532	Well, I thought at its core it was about this rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted about closely related offenses.	1
453181	Well, but that's--	0
4438091	Is that correct?	1
424913	Right.	0
3349767	No. I say,	1
104376	circumstances.	1
4363778	You haven't interrupted anybody.	1
6837934	So the release was in response to that order of the Federal court?	1
812586	Well, it... it appeared, at least to me, to look to those areas where Congress required the Coast Guard to make regulations.	0
4933429	Yes. Yes, but --	1
6438737	Olson, would you address again the jurisdictional problem here? I mean, if if in fact the district court judge had discretion about what sentence to impose and could've and did exercise that discretion, do we have to be concerned about juris-	1
1735143	And I would have thought it was a much more general proposition, that if the Coast Guard adopted some general regulations in this area, that's enough, and that you wouldn't look to see how closely OSHA's regs matched in every detail the Coast Guard regs.	1
4306510	Wouldn't an arrest have been more intrusive?	1
2096700	Why... why then didn't you try to get an injunction in the district court in Alabama?	0
4797447	The Court remains in session.	1
9486211	They won't arrest someone for several charges?	1
9562922	It doesn't say it wasn't valid; it says specifically what you do.	1
6153928	Because?	1
890069	Well, I -- I understand.	0
3521770	Mr. Baker, are there not courts where something like this would come into the clerk's office, the signature is lacking, the clerk would say, well, it was filed within the ninety days, so we'll send it back with the letter, very much as this Court does.	1
602681	Well, but here... well, let's... let's get back to the... the relator.	0
1407367	I mean, Hawaii as a State has set up this scheme, and if the scheme were to permit voting by others, does that violate anything Congress has set out?	1
7988267	Of course, we have... we have so many references to God in our daily lives in this country.	1
8758786	Mhm.	1
1046321	So that's it for ozone.	1
5883104	--and how do you equate it with other exercises of such a right?	1
187256	It made the decision that it was probable cause.	0
6993657	But if it's owned by the state of New York, if it's been acquired somehow by the state, then what?	1
45102	I'm talking about 504.	0
9340168	They never did that, they didn't do it in the...	1
5746461	You are contending that you had no cause of action against the prime, that any cause of action against the prime for his breach of contract with you was suspended by the labor code.	1
3090127	--Justice Ginsburg, our position was that there was no need for national uniformity in the sense that the Court need not grant review to impose a national... national uniform rule.	1
1767400	advisory...	1
307507	Page 108 of the petition for cert.--	1
9072011	What we're asking you to speculate on is if the Government prevails and we say, fine, you can take the gas tank off, you don't have to have any degree of reasonable suspicion.	1
7613849	This seems so unlikely, your interpretation, and I want a response to it.	1
8106547	You appear to be arguing today that the State itself is deprived of property under this scheme, and when it's a proprietary licensing scheme that is the situation.	1
6321752	Well, it's not what we said in Holmberg.	1
74378	I thought they had been sequestered.	1
5610172	Judge Tatel had a different view of how these two subparts worked, did he not?	1
610785	Do you question,	1
7570259	[Laughter]	1
146476	It's 100 percent dollar-for-dollar.	1
6765122	missed it. What's...	1
1440025	Now, whether what's done fits that I don't know.	0
8740999	But I, but I was saying...	1
1754825	And one question as to whether it's preempted, I would think, would be can they go back to the Federal ratemaker and... and, in fact, get the relief that they want.	1
4306516	She... the wife says, who lives in the trailer with the husband, that her husband has put pot under the couch.	1
9105130	and coming back and...	1
1813669	It sounds like the ALJ's description was probably... didn't get it quite right, and I take it that your opposing counsel here concedes as much.	0
7409831	Yes.	1
7992073	[Laughter]	1
8436362	There's not one of those statutes that limited investment contract to a variable return and excluded fixed return, was not one of those cases under the Blue Sky statutes that excluded fixed return investment contracts from the definition of investment contract.	1
132612	--Mr. Sutton, there were congressional findings that there has been discrimination against the disabled in voting, health services, transportation, education, and so on, and there are numerous examples in the legislative record, and those are areas of traditional State control.	1
3213091	anyway t- t- to use an example.	1
3113276	y- the-	1
6283353	And you ha-	1
2143028	At what... at what point did the Department of Interior take the position that you could get a mining claim under the mining act for sand and gravel claims?	1
1188723	I think there's another element that you're ignoring.	0
5716315	for their...	1
3248073	I... one of the briefs does, the City of Boston, includes in its prohibition against discrimination ex-convicts.	1
6261820	[Laughter]	1
223600	323(b), the restrictions on state parties, usurps law by imposing this Orwellian definition of Federal election activity which sweeps in virtually, virtually all activities of the state parties during even years, subjects it to a Federal $10,000 limit and then perhaps most invasively imposes the homegrown requirement which makes it difficult, if not impossible, for states to transfer money among themselves.	1
9005279	--But form 58... I'm... I'm looking at page 58... says that the prisoner will be given this form that says you were referred to the classification committee for the following reasons.	1
986449	But your argument is a little extreme in the situation where, by State law, the defendant has to be there, and any time the defendant testifies, even if it's totally consistent with his prior but excluded confession, you say the prosecutor can nonetheless get up in summation and try to use his presence at the trial against him.	0
7246634	Well, what if the arresting officer just doesn't give a reason for the arrest, just makes the arrest, and it turns out, at the end of the day, that indeed there were objective facts that would have justified an arrest.	1
2529279	--assume, for a moment, that we didn't; could we, nonetheless, address the active inducement--	1
7683985	things that you...	1
3463804	But I'm asking you.	1
4303050	One...	1
5536642	What's your position on the jury instruction?	1
4127688	Three people in the car.	1
2961355	to stop.	1
1771417	But what it... what the Ninth Circuit theory seems to me to do is to equate the likelihood of consumer confusion with bodily appropriation.	0
1654196	there...	1
9658025	That could be, Your Honor.	1
7427757	You don't want us to know about water being in two classes?	1
59556	What has this Court historically done, do you think, on appellate review standard for mixed questions of fact and law?	0
4377949	otherwise to the Ninth Circuit...	1
5073009	I would have thought we wouldn't, that our cases would have said not, that wouldn't be enough to waive sovereign immunity.	1
7444054	You said something...	1
9231275	reasonable.	1
1123713	--When--	0
4453734	His point is this just shows how hard it is to do.	1
6582601	I invite the Court's attention to exhibit 17 and particularly pages 116 through 119 of the joint appendix, and this is the type of note that the...  the respondent will say, well, this was not our document, this was one of our distributor's documents, but it's alleged in the...  in the complaint and there is evidence to support that this is...  this was out there available for investors to see.	1
4976064	I assume the Girl Scout meetings are adult sponsored.	1
6407709	Didn't they have a report done?	1
6602703	Why do you think those take it out of the ordinary contract law that, you know, if the prime owes you money, you're the sub, you have a contractual right to that money, don't you?	1
1844003	Well, here we have a case where the employee did not settle, but we were really discussing with you the possibility not presented in this case of a full settlement or a judgment in arbitration, disposing of the victim-specific relief, and asking you why then should EEOC continue to have a cause of action for the victim-specific relief, as opposed to broad injunctive relief, to address the overall problem.	0
1533809	And do you think people in general thought that the APA was just setting up some kind of minimum standards here, and--	0
742800	And he recited several others, pendent jurisdiction, Younger abstention and so on.	0
1692671	alternative theories.	0
2329478	one hundred and thirty-six...	1
2024946	Your arguments seem to be equally applicable to those who are mentally ill.	0
3413307	charge one thing...	1
8403176	that they had amended it...	1
1102106	Well, in part we're relying on a Ninth Circuit case called Marrow, which we cited in our briefs, and a number of other...	0
9131829	But didn't raise, as an issue, the treatment of his... the recharacterization--	1
1933744	Is that not truthful?	1
6552584	Well, the water's left the Federal project in this case, too.	1
7278568	And under that action, presumably this respondent would be affected by the outcome of that?	1
6069870	It's a 20 percent rate, whether its roulette or card games or dice, it's all 20 percent.	1
2733213	What would have happened if the disclosure about Albuterol was made before the company announced revenue shortfalls?	1
86859	Brady and its progeny require f- disclosure only when necessary to ensure a fair trial.	1
4729891	Were those rights still extant in 1985?	1
9406155	when the g-	1
4294712	Well, it didn't expressly.	1
1464116	when the g-	1
8443119	I mean, you're saying--	1
7674058	They were talking about the allocation of the back pay which counts as wages for purposes of the Social Security Act.	1
286614	Well, do you think that because of the holding in Buckley that it's no longer incumbent upon the State to establish the interest that the State has to support this?	0
7825037	I mean, it makes no effort to apportion, and you're going to have to persuade me that that's reasonable, because I don't find anything in what you've said that makes me think that's reasonable.	1
3065430	Under the Levin amendment, it is illegal for the national parties to send even a Federal dollar to a state or local party in order to, in order to participate in a, in a joint Get Out the Vote program that the state is funding in part with Levin.	1
3057560	months.	1
2000968	I'm sorry I I didn't...	0
2432060	a situ- in a situation...	1
216133	A- are is...	1
1882469	Very well, General Miller.	1
120960	arguing?	1
3746160	But this... this scheme does something else, it seems to me.	1
6748407	Mr. Phillips, you have 2 minutes remaining.	1
1438355	Well, the problem for the court below was that the person covered can ask for it in a lump sum and pay a penalty.	0
825736	How does that enter in?	0
3423630	You would always look at the underlying claim, so that even if the underlying claim... if the underlying claim was statutory, or based upon a treaty, and then in the disposition of that claim the procedural right that was denied was so fundamental that it was a violation of the Constitution to deny that procedural right, and then the violation of that procedural right is sought to be appealed on habeas, you would dismiss it because the underlying claim, after all, is not a constitutional claim.	1
9605394	And that is a fundamental wedge between the associational rights, political parties in an area that even Senator McCain admits is fundamental to the democratic process.	1
1868791	So how does the scheme work?	0
6054369	You're arguing somebody else's case.	1
616419	Well, presumably at a much earlier date, the prisoner did know that he... he was... he would be scheduled to be executed by lethal injection.	0
720746	Correct.	0
775084	--when it comes back?	1
1555289	Well, yes, that's...	0
4219690	In some respects, it's... looks regulatory.	1
1398713	The defendant repeats, yes.	0
7262822	the sentencing isn't a mass. Okay, thank you.	1
742763	What if... what if the tax were imposed, or a tax were imposed on the hotel itself instead of the guests?	0
2516748	And that is consistent...	1
4334117	do not know.	1
7151767	Otherwise, why are we acting?	1
2534608	of my time.	1
5781950	using...	1
143992	Can you draw a line?	0
7049545	To stray remarks by some Members of Congress or is there anything else?	1
5072265	An hourly rate that it enhances somewhat or the risk factor, or even a contingent fee could be reasonable, as long as it doesn't exceed 25 percent.	1
6196999	case.	1
1186179	This Court, when it's dealing with tax cases, it doesn't do it that way.	1
6011816	simply goes...	1
572318	Boykin,	1
6184803	We have spoken, I guess, in the Torres case that the touchstone is the clear intent to appeal, and if the document is clear as it was in this case, who the appellant is and that it was timely filed and so on, why should that be jurisdictional and not correctable later?	1
365633	Well, if the university is saying, we want every student to pay $ 50 a semester to an activity fund and we require that and it's going to be used for these activities, then why isn't that government speech?	1
2137871	--the welfare standards, wouldn't it?	1
3950644	Well, the statute doesn't say that you can only appeal a constitutional right.	1
9506963	Isn't that fairly relevant?	1
1418777	explain that he wouldn't be presenting any evidence or saying anything more?	0
203956	--Why didn't you sue the prime contractor?	1
8718623	Where there are cases at the margin, the Court will consider the motivation of the person raising the money, the person investing in the...  in the operation, the nature and type of promotion that's taking place, and...  and the motivations of the seller and things of that nature.	1
4454207	what happens if he refuses? Is he put in a different type of confinement with different terms and conditions?	1
421732	question here.	0
5002848	My question is, what could they do to preserve the evidence in these circumstances, nothing?	1
5594697	at   community...	1
5532477	Did you... was there an inflationary factor added so that the damages, say for the early sixties were computed in 1995 or year 2000 dollars?	1
903720	Uh-huh, right.	0
7087179	It's such a small segment of the problem.	1
1325447	Okay.	1
4591022	Perhaps I should have asked the question of petitioner, but his time was running out, as yours is.	1
2971658	That's correct, Your Honor.	1
48250	Yes, yes.	1
2094439	And you would take... you would make the assumption, apparently, that on that occasion the elements, the factual basis for the plea would have been disclosed.	0
638861	Must the main coach be a full-time employee of Brentwood under these rules?	1
475841	How far does this go?	0
4123077	That was... Shrink, Missouri, involved contribution limits, did it not?	1
8317709	sh- sor-	1
536024	--were not the offenses, the gun-related offense that was wrongfully imposed?	0
524127	Of course,	1
907053	--Well, I guess on the side of your opponent is the fact that these banks were created to perform an important governmental function by extending reliable credit to farmers at the lowest possible cost.	1
8992342	--Well, if that were the case, then all cigarette advertising would simply have brand names, or the photographs of the cigarette packages, and it would not have people in cowboy suits or people in bars or people in beaches doing sophisticated and healthy things, and that's just not the way the advertising is--	1
394303	[Laughter]	1
7265243	Well, two answers to that, Your Honor.	1
6334994	on the major life activity.	1
8815701	commitment.	1
327038	Let me say a few words about the allocation regulations, just to make sure that we're all clear about what the allocation regulations do and... did and do not do.	1
6531709	But, you say no court has jurisdiction because this isn't a waiver of tribal immunity.	1
1800844	And what we see today is a series of sentencing schemes that have imposed greater restrictions on the sentencing judge, given them narrower options, is that correct?	0
192510	or to...	1
776933	I mean, California wouldn't have to do it this way.	1
1419519	think that the fact...	1
2123362	I mean, we're not dealing only with intent to distribute but--	1
5943210	can also write...	1
4331982	I don't think that would be...	1
354018	I suggest, that I just, I'm not tot- -- I'm not...	0
7835092	And how would that impact on existing distribution and users?	1
1859551	Well my question to you is, is it legitimate to say there is something about this commodity that's not true of... some people are compulsive gamblers, but most people aren't.	1
1105585	But your argument is a little extreme in the situation where, by State law, the defendant has to be there, and any time the defendant testifies, even if it's totally consistent with his prior but excluded confession, you say the prosecutor can nonetheless get up in summation and try to use his presence at the trial against him.	0
818529	Yes, but this is in some ways a sort of derivative cause of action that Trinko brings with...  with the primary injured party probably being AT&T.	1
2096444	Well--	0
4104038	No.	1
6498400	can also write...	1
2388655	is unregulated.	0
1666367	Well, what if we conclude that there was an error here?	0
9043148	But are we talking about actions that constitute the commission of some kind of criminal offense in the process?	1
8688111	Well I just I hope you will address that because if he actually did something but it was somehow inadequate assistance, then perhaps Strickland is the test.	1
80879	imposed upon...	1
6392773	play on words, then.	1
1618383	What if a church asks for privilege to conduct church services once a week during the hours the school allows?	0
5627013	But this...	1
697941	What are the factors in Missouri that the State would be trying to prove to urge the imposition of death versus life imprisonment?	1
2610183	Assume that one of them is plain on the face of the record, he didn't object to... you have a whole bunch of, line of interrogation was plainly improper, and the second ground is not plain on the record.	1
6587241	It's...	1
6876711	What could Congress have provided in section 1658(a) to avoid some of these questions?	1
4203951	We are here challenging fundamental restrictions on core political party activities.	1
4607212	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.	1
9540317	time...	1
3409094	because...	1
3257782	The Federal issues?	1
1361051	It would be up to the Federal rules.	1
6146696	[Laughter]	1
1374619	--Well, there's a little more here than was true in Mitchell I. It's specific property, hold it in trust, and the Government can use it for a school or administrative needs, but there... there's something more than was in Mitchell I.	0
6299925	Right.	1
698836	That's collateral and it's nothing but an -- an investigation.	0
1384585	Everything except the coal, but did they know exactly what the coal was?	1
519421	I'm--	1
7381719	after-acquired evidence rule.	1
996166	Did we not?	0
5214728	Right.	1
7009373	Is it clear that that's happening here as well, to you?	1
3605731	I want a criterion for why she drew the line at 0.8.	1
9132154	Supposing...	1
6260281	The public isn't buying this sign, is it?	1
4555141	needs of prison administration.	1
1844814	How do we know?	0
819878	It was illusory?	1
7660135	Mr. --	1
301958	Or do you take the position that they're free to impose shackles in every case, even a traffic offense, if the prosecutor wishes to do it, without any justification?	0
1739936	--we know that the... the trial judge did not deny the continuance on the basis of a failure to comply with those rules, did he?	1
7785503	of it.	1
700538	[Laughter]	1
3426804	Yes.	1
288418	Okay.	1
8886954	That's why you just don't rest when the legislature says it's regulatory.	1
884142	Ms. Eskow, I take it all of the courts of appeals that have addressed this question have found express consent required?	0
1118548	But California doesn't apply such a presumption, does it?	0
709724	And suppose I accept them.	1
3313062	s-	1
4400394	And is that the number in the agreement, too?	1
849763	Well, Your Honor, if there are circumstances indicating the defendant might benefit from an appeal, or advice concerning an appeal...	0
925717	You've got a wire tap going, and you hear co-conspirators on... on the other end of the wire.	1
7370674	No, Your Honor.	1
4578594	[Laughter]	1
349701	Now, I assume you agree with that statement?	0
2283455	That's right.	0
4899755	statute.	1
2496585	That...	1
1521354	No?	0
3859954	--and how do you equate it with other exercises of such a right?	1
1900527	We don't know whether the taxpayer here was paying the minimum wage, because none of that was in the record, because the assessment amount was conceded.	0
2870795	Thank you, Ms. Fox.	1
2497388	Well, that's not this case.	1
1623898	And the magistrate had a question as to the credibility of this witness, and if you have a question as to the credibility of the witness then there is not sufficient facts to able to make a determination as to whether in fact there is probable cause.	0
655378	Is that the other component of what you want?	0
1662752	Tell us, in the simplest way you can, what test you think Sony stands for and how the Ninth got it wrong, if you believe it.	0
1613748	And under that action, presumably this respondent would be affected by the outcome of that?	1
5684116	What about... what about slot machines owned by farmers and slot machines owned by city dwellers?	1
7308226	What portion is wetland and what portion upland?	1
6851932	And that's kind of an indirect sort of a thing?	1
1121693	If there are no questions by the Court.	1
4757365	But what's the rationale for this scheme it does have, which just seems to go beyond what California is authorized to do?	1
2089462	But they could.	1
982920	a situ- in a situation...	1
7187879	Okay.	1
3193957	--how... how... this is... what is your response to Justice... to the argument that was made on the other side?	1
599824	Well, usually variations in language mean variations in meaning.	1
1094444	that...	0
7061206	There's some discussion in the briefs about the penalties that were imposed on the prisoner by virtue of his writing the letter that he wrote.	1
496445	Okay.	0
9061304	Well, why not do the simplest thing?	1
7763334	Even though there...  there are quite a few state laws and constitutional provisions around the country that...  that provide just that, aren't there?	1
4423292	Your court is entitled to... to view it that way from State law, but they were... they've said that State law mirrors Federal law, and just because they choose to look at it that way, that doesn't mean I have to look at it that way.	1
7187327	No canvas or solicit --	1
729156	Well, it should.	1
1142944	Ms. Blatt, what is your... what is the Government's position if the parties had expressly dealt with it in the settlement agreement?	1
7552673	It was much more controversial as to how much you're going to move against them.	1
7052627	You appear to be arguing today that the State itself is deprived of property under this scheme, and when it's a proprietary licensing scheme that is the situation.	1
595345	What... what is... what provisions of the Constitution specifically are you looking to?	1
8846205	But a constitutional line...	1
667563	When you get to the second point, and I don't mean to spoil your order, but will you sort of take up where we left off on the problem that we... some of us seem to be having in finding that there was knowledge, or should have been knowledge in '69.	1
3009045	Another thing that has to be explained away is, is the E-mail, Cohen to Cooper, as part of the legislative exchange which refers to Greensboro black, that portion of Greensboro at one of the two ends of this salamander, and referring to those districts from Greensboro as simply Greensboro black.	1
2704	It's h- It puts you in a bad position for me to ask you this, but just assume, if you would for a minute, that we think Strickland applies.	1
5285296	After you get to that... the last paragraph in your brief, you finally get--	1
4764753	here in in the terms of actually compelling him.	1
3728170	You said Ohio is now attainment area.	1
6145875	All right.	1
5524557	I didn't catch the last word, Mr.... are what?	1
2405018	As a Government funding matter.	1
4297220	Thank you, Mr. Lamken.	1
5636140	We have a hard philosophical question before us in distinguishing Milwaukee.	1
300721	--because we would be interested.	1
2266362	Was that decision wrong?	0
6500315	Your Honor, we...	1
1764594	--from the evidence?	0
6222168	Well, do you represent Mr. Hicks?	1
6849893	There's one thing on the question of how far the compound interest could compound that I don't understand, and I was... I want to ask the other side the same question, but maybe you can explain it.	1
6785028	And I can't quite understand how imposing an extraordinarily high tax on racetracks is suddenly going to provide a benefit for riverboats.	1
2132982	In order to avoid the arbitrary results that Petitioner's brightline rule would -- would impose on traffic stops, a dog sniff conducted during a traffic stop should be subject to a reasonableness analysis.	0
4969861	This methane comes up, they take the methane, but it--	1
867487	Because the Ninth Circuit said that wasn't suitable reliance, is that right?	0
4657763	Records, files,	1
5685145	Mr. Baran.	1
892799	Yes.	0
8387187	question entirely, sir.	1
6841127	ways to...	1
1024351	That's right.	0
1139689	This comes close because you say it's unconstitutional to proceed with lethal injection under these circumstances.	0
745040	But wasn't that a case involving a broad category of all women of child-bearing age whether or not you were dealing with a specific individual who had been told by the doctor you better not do this.	0
232420	in the proposed...	1
5555204	And there's a waiting list.	1
2298588	How... how did you all proceed on this assumption?	0
848381	Let's say that this is not a coordinated expense.	1
2068377	What Equal Access Act are you talking about?	1
529623	Here there was a prompt filing at the trial court level for habeas, State habeas.	0
4940148	But was... was this under the old policy that you're talking about what occurred?	1
8998095	Is there some case authority, either in the Nevada courts or the federal courts, that a federal... that a state official seeking to enforce a federal, state summons or subpoena or arrest warrant can't go on the reservation unless the--	1
1497407	It says they agree to arbitration in any court having jurisdiction, but it really doesn't grant anything that way.	1
284467	The Ninth Circuit held that an accused cannot enter a valid guilty plea unless he is first given all evidence in the prosecutor's possession which would have a reasonable probability of discouraging him from pleading guilty.	1
8620944	Suppose that it is commercially feasible to extract the methane without affecting the value of the coal estate.	1
8351841	answer.	1
4789167	Just say, the traditional common law, no interest on, no prejudgment interest on unliquidated damages, or whatever, applies, we assume it in the contract, compact, unless they work it out and say to the contrary.	1
7712794	Is this... are... is counsel regularly appointed for Federal habeas petitioners?	1
9619055	So it is the agency position.	1
312254	Well, there is evidence.	0
6238465	Right?	1
2667181	There's no evidence of some kind of misbehavior on the part of the city other than the bare claim that they refused to issue the permit during the process of the referendum?	1
2398808	A are you reading?	1
9018246	I mean, I would think your position could be narrower, which is just that a dismissal without prejudice to permit exhaustion doesn't count as a first petition.	1
9338465	There's your simplicity.	1
9407610	That's not Russello at all.	1
577101	You mentioned, or Justice Kennedy earlier mentioned some problems that the trier of fact would have.	1
5971274	[Laughter]	1
1573959	Is there anything else that you would rank as jurisdictional so you would be disqualified as an appellant?	1
4938782	point is even if this Court were to say that he- it's unconstitutional to execute a person who's mentally retarded, presumably it would still be open to the State to determine whether that individual is mentally retarded under the State's definition, or is there some Federal definition you're asking us to employ?	1
6623955	Well, the impairment...	1
2135214	That would be very odd.	1
7908691	large...	1
4823218	But it seems to be saying, because the cable companies do not offer separate telecommunications service, they don't have to offer it.	1
7955679	That's correct, Your Honor.	1
8232938	Two-thirds of the States don't think that that's common sense and don't provide for automatic substitution in the event of a divorce.	1
2250940	Well, i- the taxpayer is in a business that requires a lot of things.	0
7960235	We are here debating the jurisdiction under the Habeas Statute, is that right?	1
366512	Three seems to be the closest to it.	1
3779353	--What is the Government's position on a State law that prohibits adult bookstores from having a sign in the front which says, adult bookstore, or a sign that says, pornography on sale here--	1
7422054	--do we not?	1
9128105	Hm?	1
5670411	that even if...	1
8487763	[Laughter]	1
557834	No, Your Honor.	1
7235514	You just determine whether this person convicted... should be convicted of first degree murder.	1
750872	Why not? Literally it...	1
4708592	Well, but it's certainly... that the FDA considers only safety, and nothing else, that it was directed at generic drugs, not others, and that there was a cutoff point earlier than that argued by the Government and the Petitioner for what is exempt preclinical trial information.	1
3069590	Thank you, Ms. Bunn.	1
152021	It's excluding the party from doing many things that wouldn't be corrupting, right?	1
3344995	for their...	1
3395068	we...	1
1921867	No and I'm not...	1
3435746	Thank you, Mr. Coleman.	1
5810912	This Court has repeatedly said is that these terms are overlapping...	1
3324420	In other words,	1
1685267	And... and it's hard to justify, under this statute, finding a cause of action before there's any damage or if there isn't any.	0
8366740	But, I'm still saying the reasonable import of that language, the unequivocal import of that language with regard to a state might well be that you can only bring suit in the state court.	1
8613214	Is a substantial... if we said the... if flood control is a substantial reason for the facility and for the operation that caused the damage, could you go back for trial on that?	1
5472038	I'm just late.	1
1056970	I guess standard tort principles don't seem to help us much.	1
4444149	Well, the public isn't buying it.	1
4751883	But this...	1
7230812	Well, this statute requires you to make the government's message four times a year.	1
642801	Let me ask you. Go ahead.	1
5496971	There are instances of contributors to individuals who are also contributors to the party, and I suppose those instances do not stand out as outrageously obvious examples of, you know, something close to quid pro quo because the amounts are small.	1
9579216	Well, how would...	1
5719019	And here, and here--	1
1584307	[Inaudible]	1
6811286	You can issue a COA only if there is a substantial claim.	1
6905197	petition. But...	1
8115514	What is... is there any... do you have any response to this claim that the high recidivism rate itself supports the argument that, in fact, this is nothing but a safety information kind of measure, whereas broadcasting all criminal convictions would not be justified as having a good fit between the object and what the State was doing?	1
5769025	Well, in Bumpers,	1
8720460	[Laughter]	1
1755562	They're...	0
3107831	eighty-two.	1
1898728	One other point.	1
5368006	But but your isn't isn't...	1
176921	Well, that would...	1
8569483	Would you tell us where we could find section 1729?	1
194500	But does the subcontractor have a contractual right against the prime or not?	1
1542218	But the main coach, even in the private school, would have to be a full-time employee?	1
361717	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.	1
8382176	Well, that's true, but I must say when your response to the... one of your responses to the allegation of racial districting is, no, this was incumbent protection, and when the incumbent you're trying to protect is an incumbent who was elected from an unconstitutionally constituted district, that is the prior district which was held to be unconstitutional, I think that the defense of incumbent protection just washes out to say you're going to protect this incumbent means you're going to make sure that the person who was elected by racial gerrymandering will continue to be elected.	1
2202743	So under the theory of the Government, that is a Federal claim.	0
8976692	What about the provision of the Restatement, which came out, I guess, in 1932?	1
6335502	I don't see it either. I'm looking at page --	1
7396246	The early statutes?	1
2302990	How do you describe the test applied by the board?	0
524805	States cannot follow this income-first rule, maybe they would just respond by reducing the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance and adjust it that way.	0
959385	Well--	0
4551658	the abeyance...	1
5166839	--I think the kick of the gas tank or the tapping showed it was full, not hollow.	1
45580	that...	0
8807321	Are you going to discuss that, the proper measure of damages?	1
6225516	why restaurants -- every employer should hire...	1
8535293	Is the rate... is the rate for taxing other gaming activities on the riverboats different from the slot machines on the riverboats?	1
1858478	No, the record doesn't tell us.	0
2110555	It was a-	1
9230538	that's not the case with question one.	1
6749810	That's exactly the opposite of what you're saying in the first part of your argument.	1
8398791	[Laughter]	1
8833142	account...	1
3387442	Contained in...	1
1572291	access to...	1
3624725	Do you think he has waived any due process claim insofar as it applies to the sentencing?	1
1039097	And I think one could make an argument for a different approach.	0
2362412	If you think gender discrimination cases aren't different, you're just wrong.	1
4893324	About...	1
8392342	are...	1
8627051	Why does...	1
5937970	And so this is a condition that the Government has the right to impose.	1
4217669	[Laughter]	1
4108525	Is there any... I have assumed... there is no indication in the record, but I will ask you, is there any indication in the legislative record that there was in effect a legislative agreement between the tobacco companies and the people who were pushing the legislation that, in response to withdrawing tobacco company opposition to some things that the companies didn't like, there would... they would be rewarded by a preemption ban as broad as you are arguing for?	1
391494	Well, I guess you would be content with just relying on whatever was disclosed at the plea colloquy in court.	0
6734950	[Laughter]	1
2474674	versus Roe...	1
8987045	Do you read Allegheny as saying that the... if the State had enacted exactly the scheme that was being administered there, that it would pass equal protection review?	1
2092253	Oh, I see--	1
6331029	was...	1
2267553	How far does this go?	0
494630	--for a State to tax--	1
1792026	What is it now?	1
545853	Well, let me ask you this.	1
9006716	That's quite different.	1
9046408	the need...	1
8557529	There's no escape from it.	1
1455304	Well, you said we could affirm if we applied Cronic, but I thought the issue was whether perhaps Strickland applied, and if Strickland applies, I wouldn't think we'd be affirming necessarily.	0
8488276	And that's why they're doing it.	1
1302971	In a trial situation it can usually be assumed that the defendant does want to continue the litigation.	0
9201328	Please proceed, Mr. Pescetta.	1
7020415	And that is, now... it had two premises.	1
457217	All right.	0
5642910	How does that change anything?	1
8679825	--if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?	1
184255	is that it?	1
9289741	Your Honor, I would say that that sentence --	1
6744605	I thought his point was it was an even broader universe.	1
3803923	Can I...	1
2830159	Exactly.	1
6635150	The relevant... page six on the blue brief.	1
3622382	Why is... should that be different from what we held in the Milwaukee case for admiralty?	1
8735205	Mr.	1
192996	And respondent was a front seat passenger?	0
6734249	Is that your position?	1
5691262	If you drew the line at when the work is performed, that's a different question it seems to me.	1
6878620	And that leaves space to be filled out.	1
2273566	It was a state court matter.	0
2298438	Do you think that would be okay?	1
4789830	Yes, and other things, destruction of property and so forth, I suppose.	1
3249988	Is that testimonial or not?	1
1668210	but he specifically...	1
8615197	It would be irrational for Congress to say, well, we've got a catch-all for those...  from A to Z...  that go from A to H that look more...  look like equities, but not S to Z that look more like debt, and then we're don't...  not sure about the ones in the middle.	1
917827	The Court has never made this distinction.	1
9507432	Prisons has...	1
3838143	What's the test for State action, in your view?	1
3212908	They... they set out specific percentages with respect to Alaska.	1
1127098	Should we apply Arkansas Electric and say that's binding?	0
4627169	[Inaudible]	1
9190019	It starts by saying, no statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in advertising, and so on.	1
999465	Here there were a couple of other--	1
2367549	in the FCC?	0
8166984	I see. Not...	1
3400483	Well, I thought Hohn said that a habeas petitioner's application for a certificate of appealability is a separate case in and of itself, and here that would make you post-AEDPA, so I don't see why that isn't a jurisdictional barrier in this case.	1
8864042	disclosure.	1
6083081	eight USC eleven...	1
508778	Now, could the school district say we are not going to allow access to any groups in off school hours?	0
7299742	Do you--	1
8613656	"""It's just advisory, don't worry. """	1
2578686	Then you're just then you're back to...	1
1137536	I know it would.	1
4486496	--Yeah, I mean this side, this side.	1
1736314	Under your theory, if... if the defendant is judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if the statements are defamatory?	0
630418	--What else should be part of the test?	0
8380364	So purely as an accounting...	1
1317858	Would that make any difference in your analysis?	1
1542556	And if so, what is it?	0
1400108	Now, do you concede that water could be released into the Madera Canal for flood control purposes, for example to make more room in the reservoir for flood waters that are anticipated?	0
1997908	[Laughter]	1
381383	Judge Lay discussed that in his concurring opinion, but the court did not rely upon that, the parties have not briefed that, and that question is not before this Court.	1
8749590	deviation.	1
4870937	Yes.	1
1787837	I mean, that's part of the problem.	1
7377124	concealed cargo...	1
4396151	But all you are telling me, General, is that... is that there are... there are reasons why one would pick the higher levels and not pick the lower levels.	1
98886	So under your test that's out, too, but we've upheld some of those.	0
6789	Concept.	1
2081968	Nowhere in that does it say that you actually have to sign.	1
782398	Why not?	0
3855	Ms. Dixon, I take it that you don't challenge the fact that the pleadings were amended to add the petitioner.	0
3638031	What's your case authority for the proposition you just stated, Mr. Sutton?	1
2080873	In other words, we're trying to find meaning here.	1
6083706	That's the--	1
8179701	--Not even a name?	1
1933465	the individual employees. And...	1
7887421	I didn't think that was the evidence.	1
8989308	Was there any suggestion that there be a delay in these proceedings while the legislature got its act together?	1
3182844	I I don't understand.	1
5284159	but...	1
2908987	Well, does this district have the authority to so provide for its own purchases?	1
6078624	let it be briefed and argued below?	1
9648629	get to work a job that is even equivalent to that.	1
5191236	[Laughter]	1
2067722	--on the legal incidence of the tax, we suggested, in the Chickasaw Nation case, that a tax statute's own declaration of the legal incidence would be dispositive.	1
4122719	Now, my next question is, is there a Tribal Court?	1
837482	question put forth.	0
5491865	Of course they're doing this because they feel there's a bad relationship between smoking and health.	1
6083913	And in the Securities and Exchange Commission v. Universal Services, another one that my colleague referred to, page 234 of 106 F. 2d, at the end of 5 years there would be returned to each member an amount equal to total contributions plus 30 percent per annum.	1
5631118	We are labeling this person a convicted--	1
1650577	Well, it is a matter of Government accounting.	0
3551746	Counsel, you're asking us in this case to say that the stay and abeyance procedure is... is not a valid procedure.	1
8798185	The fact that a special ed...	1
1704089	Well, your... I'm sorry. That's a proposition a little hard to maintain, because in the age discrimination area this Court has never found a violation of the rational basis test, but in the handicapped area we've found a bunch of violations.	1
9523188	[Laughter]	1
2985504	Do we know -- do we know...	1
1706838	Well, in any event it looks like there might be some factual concern here.	0
4899529	Now, I'm just saying how does it differ--	1
8328505	conditions.	1
7054421	What's the difference?	1
3694532	In other words, it is not... but your argument is not that the settlement covered what he claims.	1
8476430	If that's -- is that...	1
7848002	factors.	1
9180430	been m- making these assessments, please,	1
1061826	I suggest, that I just, I'm not tot- -- I'm not...	0
6650	Well, certainly in that...	1
1816344	What if, under the plan, it's true that the districts reduced the black voter population somewhat from the prior districting, but in so doing, they picked up enough black voters in another district that gave them an additional elected official of the minority race--	1
8277945	statute.	1
8688819	be. That's what you said in your brief.	1
6637698	We didn't... we thought that there was no unfairness in the existing divergence of approaches among the courts of appeals, because in each court of appeals, a defendant had notice of the particular approach that applied in that circuit, and so a defendant knew ahead of time whether he had to raise its ineffectiveness claim on direct appeal, or whether he could wait without penalty and raise it on collateral review.	1
5847839	That's correct, Your Honor.	1
5073773	Is that what you're--	1
1858250	Yes.	0
3799253	If you... if you--	1
7595227	Mr. Shipps--	1
3046001	Yes, that's...	1
125012	But if...	1
6436406	--in income?	1
4247022	Well, but if this was dismissed on the pleadings... they said they were prepared to show that.	1
2107929	--making this same argument?	0
2920745	The majority... it appears that the majority of States go the other way, but it's not entirely clear, Justice Stevens, because some of the States haven't spoken directly on the question.	1
7207857	we dealing with here? You don't have much time, and I am concerned.	1
8216676	Well, I don't know.	1
7493735	really.	1
3572355	I just couldn't find anything that really showed me what we were dealing with.	1
7642609	Coughs don't count or transient effects don't count.	1
9006222	which would be...	1
6738002	But they could.	1
687443	But that isn't what you've said in the question presented.	0
1157760	Well I was...	1
4423551	to save my husband's life?	1
194945	Even if it's discovered after that time?	1
2339395	Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you suppose?	0
1114154	And would you also address at some point how the treaty on Safety of Life at Sea would affect the resolution here?	0
6818500	and coming back and...	1
861397	That's very different from just court access, as in Tennessee versus Lane, and it could require very extensive requirements, perhaps.	1
8112629	There is also a rule, isn't there, in most common-law jurisdictions that parties deal in good faith with one another and don't pretend something, which is just illusory as you interpret this contract to be?	1
1509626	You mean the first degree burglary conviction--	0
4922097	searched.	1
3909941	In other words, don't... at the time, as it were, the parties in the Government confront the problem that you raise, haven't they in the normal course already confronted that problem in the lawsuit which results in the back-pay award?	1
1446072	That is the question of the case.	0
723400	Are they stateless...	1
5081212	What what is the definition of...	1
1425415	They preempted it and filed some kind of a suit to get an injunction before there had ever been a proceeding.	0
2775259	so that's...	1
4110303	That's right.	1
3178835	Why not?	1
7459331	the appeal...	1
8443724	on its face. So...	1
2365382	Why?	1
1412698	Now, what does it mean?	0
5838245	--that one of your points?	1
599775	On the other hand, if it were a drug-selling neighborhood or around a park where drugs are frequently sold, would it be legitimate in your view for the police to take drug-sniffing dogs and walk around the public street where cars are parked around that known drug-selling area and see if they could sniff out some contraband in the cars?	1
4541848	You're telling me it's not property until you go into court?	1
5780643	And they, but the the the likelihood...	1
8986819	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.	1
3238027	--in all those years.	1
2398227	In fact, the vast majority fail.	0
9230716	I hadn't realized your claim went that far, but I will assume it does.	1
4676857	But why isn't...	1
2863110	Have the courts of appeals which you say have applied this Rule since 1980, have they applied it only to pro se filings, or do they apply it to--	1
8837688	You could have gone up from, you know, 0.8 to 1.0 and said the same thing.	1
5611811	[Laughter]	1
6593085	Whether it's reasonable has nothing at all to do with whether it's a taking, does it?	1
7222299	I'm... my bank account was too small to cut--	1
6756639	--Is it your position that the Government can place any terms and conditions whatever on leases as long as it doesn't violate some other constitutional provision like the First Amendment?	1
1971902	I think that does create arbitrary results from the perspective of the intrusion on the individual.	0
3476832	I don't think it was pressed below.	1
1015697	The two dates, or the findings with respect to the two dates struck me as being at least possibly in tension.	1
9410246	I mean, if it doesn't, why do you get into equitable tolling at all?	1
8100946	I mean, is there any finding in the first place?	1
6973200	Does not abled --	1
1271977	the FCC didn't and why the statute...	0
9241196	You have what's the real purpose test.	1
3538492	Based...	1
672275	First, where the defendant inquires about appeal rights, and then secondly where there are circumstances indicating the defendant may benefit from such advice.	0
2925197	Throughout your opening brief, you never referred to that statute.	1
2016077	I mean, if we thought that the certificate of appealability should have been granted, I suppose you would then argue, when it went back, that those are the right tests to employ?	1
4667710	reasonable beyond a reasonable doubt, yes.	1
3180822	Excuse me. Explain that again.	1
5612846	Was this complaint...	1
6474184	Studying of theology as the...	1
8303718	They... they set out specific percentages with respect to Alaska.	1
5913966	Was this complaint...	1
2924598	[Inaudible]	1
8483044	Ms. Hart, I suppose you could have a situation where on habeas some prisoner, some person being held under a statutory scheme of this type could come in and say, on Federal habeas, I'm being held under circumstances that violate the Constitution, and make an individual challenge, isn't that so?	1
1193530	Your point is that if the same scheme that Washington has were adopted by courts, it's okay.	0
175118	Well, but in one of the arbitration clauses, I think, it says the arbitrator shall not vary or ignore the terms of this agreement, shall have no authority to award extracontractual damages at any time, including punitive or exemplary damages.	0
4737618	Well, the California Supreme Court, in announcing under State law, didn't give it that fundamental sweep at all.	1
2620335	It doesn't say what rule of evidence you follow to decide how that was made out.	1
5902205	Is there some case authority, either in the Nevada courts or the federal courts, that a federal... that a state official seeking to enforce a federal, state summons or subpoena or arrest warrant can't go on the reservation unless the--	1
5193383	[Laughter]	1
3458680	the District of Columbia.	1
1187758	No, no.	1
1659110	Why shouldn't those have been presented in the first instance to the State court?	0
373908	And I think that would be troublesome.	1
875180	of jobs...	1
9494089	Rather than getting into all that, why wouldn't we assume that the States didn't want to unless they said it specifically in the compact?	1
7025550	Or a motorcycle?	1
6885441	Well, the agency adjudicator...	1
1796191	I... every issue isn't brought to the whole body.	1
919183	You say it isn't sufficiently prompt?	1
5610598	she she she...	1
4657223	believe...	1
1509984	--Okay, so--	0
454352	So,	1
8399057	let me tell you what troubles me a little about the Government's position in the case, and I hope you will address it.	1
184392	as anything but...	1
2721795	Well, it's... it's very hard to understand how appellate review can function if that first report of the special trial judge is never disclosed.	1
177826	Well, I think that's one way to read Caballes's language.	0
168941	Are you going to discuss that, the proper measure of damages?	1
5416188	Let me ask you one other...	1
6031456	Except there's a defense if a Government agency requires a certain standard, as the DOT did here for vision for drivers.	1
5694307	That if you've got a contract within its four corners makes it clear that you're contracting about work to be done outside the reservation.	1
7222969	can assume that if...	1
1842755	I thought your... the point you were making is, you look to see what you are complaining about in the State criminal process, not when you get to the district court complaining on habeas.	1
8111613	Now, open primaries differ from the blanket primary system imposed here?	1
3204100	[Laughter]	1
8532916	Most of...	1
8915663	That... that's the law in California, what you just said, that even though you never raise it as a... as an issue in your trial, and you're in... you're in prison, many years you could then come in and under California law if it... if the statute had run, you would be released?	1
55996	Could the Government say, nobody is going to be given the addresses of crime victims, period?	0
6187825	Even if the...	1
1598647	Mr. Colbert, we'll hear from you.	1
8789151	Could we bring it down to what we have to decide here, which is whether there was retrogression or not?	1
1036176	Let me just interrupt you if I may.	1
2703878	It's not more than that, which it isn't anywhere near that, but still, let's assume that.	1
28673	I mean, nothing would foreclose them on remand or the Iowa Supreme Court itself.	1
2182509	But it's a little... it's a little like... if you're telling doctors what's medically necessary under the plan, it's in effect maybe defining the basic standards of medical care, in a way.	0
4493115	Well, by implication McNally seemed to assume that it was... the statute covers only money or property obtained from the victim.	1
3117389	Well, he did say something initially, did he not, at the sentencing phase?	1
1452116	Yes, but isn't one way to...	1
8450355	And it was done by the court.	1
2026160	--It seems to me that makes your case a little harder, because it's project-related.	1
1040378	The honorable court is now adjourned until Tuesday, October twelfth at ten o'clock.	1
349854	What's the matter with stopping transient health of adverse health effects?	1
1940899	So all right, all right, it says we really, really, really will strike it unless you sign it.	1
1569869	Very well, Mr. Pescetta.	1
4060913	Right,	1
59274	Now, there were rather lengthy instructions given to the jury in this case.	0
7072019	Yes.	1
1211997	Well, what's the standard under title VII when we talk about that, when we talk about enough evidence to shift the burden of proof?	0
3972249	And I'm asking if any of those procedures have ever been... exist with the tribe or have ever been pursued by other contracting parties?	1
3281364	challenge the Bolling rule? Is that something we've been asked to review here?	1
4372193	Thank you, General Underwood.	1
6384406	concession, to be sure.	1
436690	Here we're dealing with an individual and individual circumstances.	0
4427346	You could not commit him simply because he's dangerous and then not provide treatment?	1
5115924	I mean, if you fully completed work, and there has been no notice that you failed to pay prevailing wages, you have a right against the prime, don't you?	1
9590043	The state is making agreements for work to be done in the state.	1
7830448	If the methane comes out in drilling, as in gaseous form, and I'm a chemistry student, is the formula for the methane gas the same as the formula for, say, hard anthracite coal?	1
8371831	Well, you could sue somewhere under California law?	1
8834539	[Inaudible]	1
7504534	Is it true that the Appeals Council reviews the whole record for any conceivable error, whether or not it's been listed by the claimant?	1
3519474	No, because the line has been drawn by individuals, individuals making genuinely free, independent choices to make a dispensation.	1
7810136	Well, how would...	1
6109112	It certainly wasn't that clear from it.	1
3391445	"--I don't like to use the word ""affirmative action"", because that has a connotation in some other... but you have to take an... affirmative steps for the rest of your life in... in some cases."	1
4755051	And you're saying the Government then would be immune because it's in the river bed?	1
2029427	Right.	1
1462751	But you do agree that that states out the elements of an offense?	1
669419	That's why you're here.	1
8374281	Why should any prejudgment interest be awarded as between States?	1
7161638	Humphrey Bogart gets it there I think.	1
7537385	In this case, Tennessee.	1
364224	address...	1
2232753	Mr. Marcelle, does State law require this school district to open its facilities after school to other groups?	0
5905428	twenty-one Q in particular.	1
8981470	I'm a stockbroker, and I'm charged with having embezzled on May 13th.	1
2835637	No, I'm assuming the Corps of Engineers.	1
1632649	Well, what is the constitutional line, in your view, about what can be an element, and what can be a sentencing factor?	0
2070301	Well, the same...  the Court would have come out the same way, I submit, if it said that ministers will not have their expenses paid, but everybody else will.	1
283778	That was never raised--	0
1785179	"What's the effect, in 1512(b), of the word ""knowingly""?"	0
2420482	This comes to us in the context of a state official who went to the tribal court to get authority to carry out a search warrant, and was given a warrant with certain terms and conditions to go on the reservation and carry it out.	1
2965771	Does that weigh in the balance at all?	1
1342910	Mr. Cole, do you know whether there are any license... city licensing schemes that say if the... in the administrative proceeding it's determined that the license should issue and it is the city that's appealing, that then it has to be expedited?	0
2371832	Noncontact visits, aren't we talking about here?	0
7420559	[Inaudible]	1
1773829	Is the Super Scoop practically capable of transportation on water, counsel?	1
1933923	I understand.	1
2279586	So all this jurisdictional stuff is beside the point, because the rules are fairly clear that there is just... even if it isn't signed, it acts just like it was signed, but it is subject to being stricken.	1
7083867	clear, I think.	1
3812956	So what the interest at stake here is the nonmembers of the NRA who want to support the policies of the NRA?	1
5686670	Right, now, who wins under those circumstances?	1
4256688	You'll lose your job.	1
1362498	But a- and...	1
7479915	Yes.	1
1143953	That's that...	1
6137420	don't you have to look at both in in trying to assess the extent of somebody's incapacity to do a major life activity? You co- you...	1
5209376	Well...	1
7415321	It's...	1
2290211	Okay.	0
4641336	Well, I think it's taken care of in several ways.	1
8391940	You... all you have to do is file a motion under this PLRA and say, we file a motion to terminate the ongoing relief.	1
2981295	that...	1
5166719	[Laughter]	1
8554415	So, the issue is...	1
8912406	You say those words do not mean, do not include state court.	1
7005573	I mean, we're talking about 332, but it's a big, complicated act.	1
7728647	So then I think it comes down to, do we do it on a proportional basis, or do you do it on a, well, if it's substantially mixed in, you lose?	1
8170481	Ms. Brinkmann, can I can I  come back...	1
2650647	Mr. Alter, if... if we think the statute may have certain ambiguities in it, why don't we owe deference to the Secretary's regulations and interpretation, which has been pretty consistent through the years?	1
8557516	I'm always afraid I'm going to miss the deadline.	1
1980726	Well, you... you have two problems here really.	1
1585892	There are millions to be made from pay...  owning payphones, watch the profits add up.	1
6832437	But in today's world, the figures, the statistics are staggering about how many narcotics are brought into our country by way of the use of gas tanks.	1
376441	If there are no further questions--	0
1080924	Is that how it's done?	0
2515224	Did the judge say it was simply beyond his authority to alter these three special issues?	1
8698846	But it's a civil goal too, I--	1
2341357	But it's a little... it's a little like... if you're telling doctors what's medically necessary under the plan, it's in effect maybe defining the basic standards of medical care, in a way.	0
5570544	I- okay...	1
180315	Well, that's... that's true.	0
1731787	Mr. Roberts, how do we determine what the patent covers?	0
290775	All right.	1
7928083	Sometimes some employees will be helped, sometimes others will be hurt, sometimes... you know, who knows, and therefore you don't have this overriding statutory goal to get the backwards allocation.	1
7426931	I take it the problem here is he wasn't given a chance to sign it.	1
5937007	four twenty-three A...	1
8762369	But in your view in looking at the standards governing EPA's setting of these national ambient air quality standards, you think that the EPA may not consider any of these economic or cost factors--	1
8731557	[Laughter]	1
9052062	And therefore, you don't get to the is he qualified question, in effect.	1
7145796	Isn't it there also an efficiency in just sending it back for new trial right away, rather than going through all of the other claimed errors?	1
3349674	agent...	1
1587380	Yeah.	0
9297443	they have this --	1
6524817	If I could turn just for one moment to the application of a procedural default rule to the facts of this case, in... if the procedural default rule were to be applied, the question at the time of collateral review is whether... is whether the defendant has introduced extrinsic evidence not available in the trial record in support of this claim of ineffectiveness, and the court of appeals in this case found that there was no extrinsic evidence material to the claim of ineffectiveness introduced in the affidavits on which the petitioner relies because the affidavits suggests avenues of inquiry the trial counsel could have pursued that trial counsel in fact did pursue.	1
3704056	Thank you, Mr. Porter.	1
2438636	Given that it's a small segment of the problem, what showing is there that there are enough problems with this small segment of corruption that justifies the limit?	1
4911369	require a...	1
836478	1996.	1
5560893	In this case--	1
7141019	As of...	1
618884	What it seemed to do was to reach the merits and say at the end of the day, these people have no rights.	0
3562419	thing.	1
6483100	That was the finding of the magistrate and the--	1
6229564	In some cases, assaults and so forth.	1
769082	Sullivan, in light of the Johnson case and the Neder case, I think the government has a very strong argument here.	1
387230	Well, Your Honor, actually his argument is that he thought he was going to get 3-1/2 years, and there is simply no support for that.	0
7531203	It couldn't be clearer that the accident there occurred from flood waters, in the real sense of flood waters.	1
3603298	So, the real real significance of the...	1
3207835	I mean, the decision to join the association has to be a... you don't acknowledge that that decision is an official public school decision?	1
1968001	Don't you think this Court would have the power of review and to issue rulings on what the law is so that it would be uniform?	0
5732695	Here there were a couple of other--	1
906098	I don't know whether he runs into problems under Roberts, because what Roberts as I have read the opinion objects to is the capriciousness, the fact that the jury could act with no evidence at all.	1
2569783	reasonable...	1
3523725	Footnote 26 or something?	1
5206638	your question presented seems to be quite narrow.	1
6264130	Well, there's a big difference between being, say, in Seattle, Washington, and Ellis Island, never being able to get off the island.	1
1903788	Well, he... Mr. Wright gave several examples of situations where courts, apparently properly and with our approval in some instances, have decided certain things other than subject matter jurisdiction before reaching the merits, and that have disposed of the case insofar as the Federal court is concerned.	0
946871	Well, does the right to association while in prison survive in some form, do you think?	0
4676311	Well, but we now have Milwaukee, that confirms that.	1
5968996	I thought you were asking to do more, not to leave... to say the Ninth Circuit test is no good, because it's wholly-related... not-unrelated won't do.	1
2304717	difficult type...	1
4376921	But, that isn't a matter of the record.	1
4627322	Any... any interest acquired.	1
7190315	What's wrong with their argument?	1
8322878	given that conundrum,	1
6113878	And in light of Saffle, I... I don't see what you have left going for you on that argument.	1
4511921	Do we?	1
1088053	Well, just to make sure... I think this was Justice Breyer's hypothetical.	1
6350782	Well, there are other ways to do it--	1
2958429	And yet the... the trial judge herself said to defense counsel, aren't you going to move for a continuance, when this bullet came... was unearthed after all that time.	1
944594	Well, now, wasn't Ramirez a no-knock entry where the door--	0
432442	Yes but in this case there is not a claim comparable to your third example.	1
4845072	In those cases, as I recall, the public trustees were voting in their public capacity.	1
2558007	[Laughter]	1
111768	Chevron deference.	1
1837313	You failed to sign it; therefore the valid notice would be stricken if somebody discovers it wasn't signed.	1
5131314	What do you think about that?	1
4924140	under Michael Williams versus...	1
1155823	I understand that, but I'd like to know what your theory is.	1
4681734	What...  what the question presented here is considerably more narrow, the question presented here is it...  is...  is it disqualified as an investment contract simply because the return is fixed or specified?	1
2804101	And it doesn't mean opinion, so if... so long as they reach the right result, even if their opinion is all messed up, and recites the law quite incorrectly, so long as they stumbled into the right result somehow, that's okay.	1
580922	It wasn't a going to trial and he was told certainly of all the things that could be involved in a trial and how an attorney would be helpful but was not told, I guess, expressly that if you plead guilty, you can be represented by counsel and the attorney might give you useful advice.	0
5481291	Is it?	1
2652495	Yes, or over his vote in the association.	1
7290776	That's what you want us to do?	1
7081243	The decision below that these transactions were not investment contracts merely because they specified a fixed return to the investor, rather than an unspecified portion of the enterprise's profits, can not be squared with the language, history, and purpose of the Securities Acts, 70 years of consistent SEC interpretation and enforcement, and this Court's jurisprudence.	1
2472031	the appeal...	1
4632446	particular...	1
6054316	I think that's right, Justice Kennedy.	1
4124441	Did they refer to the special issues in their comment on the instructions?	1
5129507	Very well, Mr. Mashburn.	1
4965884	Your real objection is that...	1
5350579	Do you join the amici in saying Almendarez-Torres has to be overruled?	1
2329511	Yeah.	0
7054492	Under what section?	1
7507845	But if the Coast Guard were silent on some of these points, you still think there is Federal--	1
4632603	dispersal of business...	1
3370189	where will I find that?	1
8575809	This is very different. We could make that argument.	1
1474987	It was not Castro's urging.	0
2169043	Yes, well, we reserved the answer to the question in TLO, whether it would be the same answer if law enforcement were involved.	1
5645950	Well, what about attorney's fees in class actions?	1
7966921	He said I want to fill this.	1
8267501	be a tip. There...	1
2462083	What?	1
3268384	If you do, you don't need all these facts.	1
4139656	unless the benefits have started.	1
9574070	You do.	1
6915193	feel some...	1
5412780	Ms. McDowell?	1
4009170	Do you call witnesses?	1
2349656	The GFF, which you say is analogous to a forum, and then the...  the student referendum mechanism, and what's the third?	0
6831443	Well, I I...	1
2148013	There's no violation unless there's a policy.	1
7777247	Probably not, but I just wonder about the kind of practice if the lawyer doesn't point it out to the court.	1
1976983	It seems to me you're suggesting that we treat the Congress of the United States as a trial court and remand the case to them to prepare better findings.	1
1585775	--Yes... but no, it's the other part.	1
4419340	If you agree with them, then summary judgment was wrongfully denied to the police officer, is their view, I think.	1
1576848	Well, first of all, that would be just an allegation, which is why a prompt investigation would be needed.	0
8098225	of...	1
766148	It also deals with addresses of victims of crimes, as I understand.	0
5612262	It is not passive.	1
4125942	I... I just... I just don't understand your theory.	1
1097879	In other words, you want to support a per se rule no matter what.	0
6789755	sale of it.	1
3402333	The effect of the California provision would be to not allocate it at all.	1
2139234	The defense attorney went over the probation report with him the day before sentencing, and then when he was sentenced to 15 years to life he expressed no surprise at that.	0
7293671	And it turns out... do you concede that that was, in fact, not a lawful grounds for arrest?	1
3464235	Is there anything in the record--	1
7179245	The Master also decided that there had been no undue delay on the part of Kansas in not instituting suit for another, what was it, 17 years, something like that?	1
2286110	So what's the difference between that and these users just suing Colorado themselves?	1
1703755	Yes... is you can.	1
1728390	No, but please come back to my question.	1
1202693	And I... is there any reason why a lawyer who is governed by the act in a situation where the lawyer is providing monitoring services... is there any reason why the lawyer couldn't withdraw if the lawyer thought, well, this is just not enough for me?	1
7442415	I I I I don't know f- f-	1
9476900	I mean, if your client wanted to go into Tribal Court to enforce it, I wouldn't have thought Montana would be a barrier.	1
985390	But presumably that report was in the file some place.	1
4632502	--And that's our whole concern here.	1
129977	Now, do you take the position that the Federal Government couldn't enforce any provision of such an agreement either?	0
267792	have...	1
7823134	strict...	1
4472652	Well, you don't know...	1
4845293	Mr. Bell, wouldn't that be, wouldn't that be...	1
8588462	During institutionalization.	1
3867113	Well, they have a physician's exam and report.	1
7524629	What if we look at the videotape and think that is not excessive force?	1
209115	So that...	0
1573025	What is the... why does the restriction on coordination give you a problem?	1
1376771	I mean, if we were just reviewing the verdict, you might be right.	0
6779561	We have to find the answer to that before we know whether there's evidence.	1
3505774	Thank you, Mr. Sutton.	1
7009098	[Laughter]	1
2200006	No, Your Honor --	1
583615	Well, in... in Batson, I guess the opinion for the Court suggested that it was basing it on the title VII cases, the McDonnell Douglas formula.	0
1176799	Well, Your Honor, I think he did understand that he was going to get 15 years.	0
8168666	But we're talking about border searches with customs officials who are trained and they have limited budgets.	1
2040455	What is that requirement?	0
8758949	And what... what role did that play in all of this?	1
1933839	It's so odd.	0
2040924	But why wouldn't the principal, when he or she goes to the meeting and casts a vote, it seems to me that that principal, when he or she casts a vote, must be acting in a State capacity because that's why that principal is there.	1
1506959	Suppose there's a pool of oil under my neighbor's land, and just a little bit of it comes onto my land, can I sink a well and suck out all of his oil?	1
5139496	0 [offmike.]	1
8715481	Now, what should we do about that?	1
7292506	raise the issue? Why isn't that more important than what you did raise?	1
3680847	Now at this level you max out again.	1
6205592	--I suppose you could also say that even though literally it would apply to both situations, there's a longstanding tradition of not applying it in the case where the statute has not run, and so you would construe that exception rather narrowly.	1
1108505	a rooftop...	0
966086	This case is about the authority of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assess FICA taxes that Congress has imposed on employers.	0
4040181	Court has addressed the...	1
982189	It contemplates, does it not, the payment of substantial amounts of money to the State thereafter, and does that distinguish it, or make it somehow more of a property interest than otherwise might be the case?	0
2190202	That's not what this Court has held, i- particularly in United States versus Janis, where in fact the assessment there was based on an estimate of wagering taxes.	0
6540330	that it would be.	1
5564560	I take it, then, that the only... that there will always be immunity if the release is, in fact, an intentional release as opposed to the negligent release, because whenever there is an intentional release, as I understand your reasoning, there will be, in fact, the creation of space to hold flood water.	1
7293274	They gave them permission to have these slot machines, which they didn't before, so they're preferring the racetracks by giving them this, but they say not too much because we're going to let you make money from these slot machines, but not too much.	1
5830865	Did they exist in 1985?	1
6313257	Yes...	1
9654653	Are you going to address those issues of whether the State is a person and the Eleventh Amendment concerns?	1
1860307	we...	1
9605359	Exactly.	1
1252895	Well, what if we conclude that there was an error here?	0
990288	she she she...	1
299277	I mean, just imagine--	0
6213296	got me...	1
2236133	I mean, that looks pretty much like second guessing to me.	0
5139678	You don't--	1
1461487	bookstore, and th- that's...	1
5407078	--also had a similar ban, as I understand it.	1
9646969	It never did what could have been, what could have ended this debate very swiftly.	1
25377	to support...	1
2255961	But didn't they... in order to be covered, didn't they have to be employees?	1
945892	Has there ever been any motion to clarify this terrible inconsistency?	1
506216	Mhm.	1
7719289	In a document I have called the Post Flood Assessment it says that flood releases may also be made of the Friant Current Canal and Madera Canal if all parties agree, and that's rather baffling to me--	1
6456564	Yes.	1
3705934	Whether your theory is that you always look to the underlying claim, or the defeat of the underlying claim, or the procedural claim is a... arises to the level of a constitutional claim.	1
3888917	Much more...	1
1939057	Iowa... the Iowa court made the statement, as I understand it, that the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the national Equal Protection Clause had identical requirements at least for the purposes of this case.	1
1276225	--We've not?	0
1164187	[Laughter]	1
8677325	Well, what if the coal miner digs into the coal and in the process releases this gas that you say the petitioner owns?	1
424837	They gave a percentage in their brief, I forget, it was... it was a surprisingly high percentage.	0
2777009	What about a forum selection clause?	1
4473343	What is the source of... of law for our decision?	1
8509737	They must have it.	1
44770	--Justice Scalia, we are not here today to defend the constitutionality of the allocation regulations, but I did sense that there might be some misunderstanding about how they operated, and I wanted to at least make clear that the allocation regulations do not purport... did not purport to regulate purely state and local candidate activity, at the national party level or at the state party level.	1
5981443	Well, I really think that's irrelevant and that's... Justice Breyer suggested there should be a cap, that assumes the Government doesn't have to be reasonable on an ongoing basis, I think that's just wrong.	1
3982794	But before you strike it, you give a person a chance to sign it.	1
5451339	been true.	1
1986967	Not under the statute, Justice Rehnqu- Chief Justice Rehnquist, but rather under the laws that this Court has observed.	0
4191407	Well, what about someone who is truly a dangerous sex offender, who poses a real risk to children in that area?	1
2665093	in looking at the manual task approach, how how is the fact finder supposed to decide which manual tasks are sufficiently important to constitute a substantial limitation? I mean, how do you weigh that? H- how do we decide it? Is there any guidance on that?	1
8153371	could r- could Right.	1
1176850	Well, Your Honor, there's an obligation under only two circumstances.	0
2106231	And it's hard to know from your argument the answer to that.	0
1284331	And you contend that the school has, instead of doing that, opened a limited public forum allowing some groups to use the school in off hours?	0
2034537	Thank you.	0
4719757	he do -- What...	1
2067222	I thought that the law itself said that this is the only remedy that the remedy of the prime or its assignee suing was the only remedy, was the exclusive remedy.	1
7350093	It seems to me you're suggesting that we treat the Congress of the United States as a trial court and remand the case to them to prepare better findings.	1
1612079	The red brief, in page two?	1
315520	There are situations like the Reves case where the Court said, well, some notes are securities, some notes are not securities, and then goes through...  what the Court in that case was looking at, a Second Circuit decision that said, well, some notes are not securities, some are securities, and then laid out a methodology, which, by the way, is the same methodology that the SEC understand...  well...  widely understood to employ with respect to those cases at the margin.	1
448292	Is there some reason why we shouldn't do that here?	0
1820887	And in Arkansas Electric, I think we held that a Federal decision to forego regulation in a given area may imply an authoritative Federal determination that the area is best left unregulated and would have as much preemptive force as a decision to regulate.	0
5490451	circumstances.	1
4245847	No.	1
3279908	States de-	1
9071087	I don't want people knowing what my...	1
7917335	I mean, you... you would still have some testimonial statements in there.	1
9621485	can only act through its employees, and if those employees are subject to Bivens liability, if they are, why isn't that enough...	1
6962596	--Kennedy gave you, why isn't that covered by the QDRO section--	1
7457643	The decision below that these transactions were not investment contracts merely because they specified a fixed return to the investor, rather than an unspecified portion of the enterprise's profits, can not be squared with the language, history, and purpose of the Securities Acts, 70 years of consistent SEC interpretation and enforcement, and this Court's jurisprudence.	1
1651400	So you read our precedents as saying our inquiry must be simply confined to a facial inquiry, and not to the reality of what the treatment is or is going to be?	1
5257434	What would your...	1
9096148	Do you know--	1
7935873	What is your example?	1
2186331	So are you here to say if Washington State's legislature said that for a burglary conviction that a judge can sentence anywhere from 10 to 20 years.	0
5950904	Is it past defendants?	1
1715976	I'm sorry I I didn't...	0
246287	It's the 5-year offense.	0
7245446	[Laughter]	1
4427164	has the contract.	1
8031964	State law.	1
1933104	equipment.	0
3610706	proving...	1
6264777	It is an administrative convenience.	1
1765692	I thought we were looking at aggravated felony, and does not Florida make it a felony, a serious felony, if you cause serious bodily injury?	0
2276837	But certainly the... the... the defendant can waive his right to counsel later on, and he did.	1
4062602	Well, certainly in the civil-case context, generally, the interpretation has been pretty broad.	1
5416269	not?	1
897911	It's... it's sort of like pornography: I know it when I see it.	0
2450022	but it's not.	1
5320828	Here Mr. Ford chose dismissal without prejudice.	1
4426698	Well, does... does any entity in a society, a... a nursery school have an interest in... in knowing the background of their employees?	1
9238871	--open to the Federal Courts.	1
793702	Well, even if there are arguable grounds for appeal...	0
944574	Well, what if the...	0
9262542	Yes, but the Ninth Circuit did say that the Madera Canal is not a flood control project and serves no flood control purpose.	1
5110980	Two cases.	1
8980007	The word nullification instruction is almost an oxymoron, isn't it, because you think of nullification jury as refusing to follow an instruction rather than following one.	1
102526	Right.	1
9625351	I think Lebron is not so much in point because there was a lot of top-down governmental delegation there that is different than in this case, precise delegation from the legislature, Pennsylvania and Evans, much closer.	1
5444390	Right. Per month. Right.	1
1054757	Well, they...	1
825354	I mean, that's why it placed the jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.	0
1750578	think that's the standard adopted in the court below that we're reviewing?	1
1849648	I'm just surprised that California is resisting having such a system.	1
2340225	question.	1
3974509	Well, I do take issue with that.	1
8402604	Well, why not do the simplest thing?	1
1224219	In your example, Mr. Chief Justice, if he's pondering, then he's not being diligent.	0
5370817	--Your Honor, allow me to disagree with that justification.	1
1002192	Is that right?	1
5336101	Mr. Miller... General Miller, you have four--	1
9562603	I mean  it...	1
4077122	required here. i- It would be in the regulations, Your Honor.	1
3863483	That's true, Justice Kennedy. The -- uh-huh.	1
5435021	Well...	1
4865694	precludes us from f-	1
6600393	Of course, that's true, but in my mind rings a case, in which I was in dissent, but the majority has the law, and that's Hendricks.	1
6119443	offered.	1
2466031	Well, the Supreme Court of Iowa in... in its opinion in this case said that the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the Federal clause were the same or subject to the same analysis, didn't they?	1
8754484	All right.	1
9156387	And they put that right in the preamble to the act.	1
7919383	Let's let's assume...	1
5253420	but he specifically...	1
98682	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten [= 10] o'clock.	1
5484587	last twenty years? I count two.	1
771662	It can be a reasonable accommodation.	1
1021572	[Laughter]	1
3203966	That's something we ought to consider.	1
6008739	depending...	1
3347570	That's not Russello at all.	1
5339508	What has it got to do with the matter that it's overly broad, et cetera, which sounds to me like a substantive due process argument, not an ex post facto argument?	1
9114364	true? Is that what having a foundation means?	1
4228262	--the basis for your statement that Congress assumed that immunity would apply when it did this particular project?	1
105284	That's a countervailing factor.	1
2105311	functions.	1
851942	This is all very important, but on the legal question that we have, do you take the position that it's a single body of water--	0
451545	It may end at the water's edge.	1
2485294	You were saying that parties can't confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court.	1
3245721	Your Honor.	1
779305	So whatever you're proposing, you think the CADC correctly employed in that case?	0
8129736	What page is that on?	1
341715	But that isn't what you've said in the question presented.	0
4199995	Adopting that definition, I don't see how more than about 1 percent, if that, could be flood water, water that would have overflowed the banks of the San Joaquin or any other of these dry places.	1
1743903	So you're saying they're using the wrong category: project.	1
6181660	Your Honor, I believe that that...	1
314311	Well, I think Mancari deserves some comment, where special provisions and preferences were provided for Native Americans.	0
2104390	It's very hard to understand how the Ninth Circuit ruling comports with what we said in Ray.	0
554962	The question this case presents is how the commissioner carries out his obligation under sixty-two oh one to assess the tax that is imposed by section thirty-one eleven.	0
1617906	--But we have no case where you can show us that it really would make a big difference in any particular appeal.	0
3063233	Judge Lay discussed that in his concurring opinion, but the court did not rely upon that, the parties have not briefed that, and that question is not before this Court.	1
3511120	--Well, they're the ones who tender the contract just like your client did.	1
1148875	that they weren't...	1
9153632	I do accept that proposition.	1
2067713	Is it... is it the obligation... is it the minute the fuel is brought into Kansas?	1
383852	Well, may I ask a question?	0
3855746	Suppose that a... a prisoner has filed in California for State post-conviction review in the superior court and then in the court of appeals and then makes no filing in the State supreme court, could but years go by.	1
1355551	So were... were... was testimony taken from legislators asking why did you vote for this bill?	1
7265275	But the Ninth Circuit would require evidence of the training of the particular dog and so forth?	1
2541261	All right.	1
1057077	All right.	1
7059066	Won't the first group, the group that says, yes, I would like to replace the present system and be able to take as much as anyone wants to give me, wouldn't that first group prefer a system in which there was no limitation upon coordinated expenditures by the party because that first group could achieve very much the same result in that way, isn't that so?	1
1886516	[Laughter]	1
6966355	Sure.	1
2694678	I'm...	1
4457708	Do you know any other jurisdiction that has required such a... a litany of warnings before a plea could be accepted?	1
155394	service.	0
1434235	But I don't understand why you don't answer Justice Ginsburg's question directly.	0
58036	They don't need to distinguish between coordinated and uncoordinated if that's what they're concerned with?	1
4872534	So what is the source of the Congress' authority over navigable waters?	1
2865304	[Laughter]	1
2258706	But not in 1512.	1
2302919	case because...	1
9242553	Very well, Ms. Zinn.	1
288835	I disagree...	1
8580594	Yes.	1
6281673	Right,	1
1049382	So at least we are... what is called into question is a uniform, consistently followed practice for five or six decades.	1
3167164	What is that?	1
2391188	But under--	0
2033670	Well, actually, there is no evidence in the record on whether the individual employees were audited or not.	0
4446362	And making it simple for people you just look to the... the quarter or the year in which the money was received, and that's when the tax is due.	1
7958340	Well, this case isn't as extreme as that, is it?	1
2087966	And I read this whole thing as a clear indication by Congress that it wanted to do exactly what the State was arguing ought to be done.	0
1993614	Well, counsel for petitioner says yes, that's a completed offense.	0
3632857	Iowa... the Iowa court made the statement, as I understand it, that the Iowa Equal Protection Clause and the national Equal Protection Clause had identical requirements at least for the purposes of this case.	1
140866	I just...	1
1136184	How... how are we supposed to define that term?	0
9239726	the requirements it has.	1
8070312	General Underwood--	1
2781079	I w- I I will defer...	1
6315835	I think the Solicitor General's response to that, if I understand the briefs, is that, in effect, is the decision that Congress reserved to itself by periodically taking up the question of revising implementation standards as it has, as we are going to get to, I guess, in the next case.	1
7471423	Well, yes, he clearly tried to preserve a role in the sentencing, but we often have guilty pleas and then leave the sentencing to be determined.	1
840280	What's your response to that?	1
2420327	That's what this was, in the public domain, was it not?	1
3776389	here and then having to address that.	1
6911507	In other words, they--	1
1103233	Thank you.	0
5199236	[Laughter]	1
9349087	That's...  that is...  that is probably not an investment contract because it is a personal transaction between individuals.	1
3834457	Probably not, but I just wonder about the kind of practice if the lawyer doesn't point it out to the court.	1
4378564	the effects on crime.	1
8978390	But, I'm still saying the reasonable import of that language, the unequivocal import of that language with regard to a state might well be that you can only bring suit in the state court.	1
5956470	Yes.	1
8103570	I was waiting for the second one but just before we get too far away from it, what was the second?	1
9049196	I mean, the State, without giving the sub even a chance to respond to these allegations simply directs the prime contractor to give the State the money owed to the sub?	1
4981320	taking away something.	1
6046257	Well, I suppose it does from the standpoint of the management required to make this scheme work.	1
2348792	So we're looking--	1
7004723	That's correct.	1
1910257	addressing...	1
41456	All right.	0
4886595	Mr. Taylor, can I just ask you one question.	1
5158911	This Court has said that it's perfectly appropriate in the adversarial system for the prosecutor to find legitimate ways to encourage guilty defendants to plead guilty.	1
3428284	That stretches it pretty thin, pretty thin.	1
4268624	I'm telling you the reg.	1
2133355	Yes.	0
877090	[Laughter]	1
5280078	Perhaps I misunderstood.	1
6784228	And he did.	1
2367037	for failure, continued failure to...	1
1689070	Yes.	1
5686161	Mr. Hufstedler, as a preliminary matter, would you clarify for us the status of some case pending now before the Guam Supreme Court that affects this case?	1
8125044	That's a that's a prospective...	1
82924	No.	0
4602043	You don't want to have one rate for the slot machines and another one for blackjack.	1
1792706	I don't see how we could possibly sustain that--	0
7718136	And is that issue being litigated?	1
1901358	There... there are arguments there for a business necessity defense.	0
3474478	just...	1
4229932	And making it simple for people you just look to the... the quarter or the year in which the money was received, and that's when the tax is due.	1
3054064	of your spouse.	1
4396748	brief.	1
2366766	What would be the situation if there were truly a vacant position at US Airways in customer service? Would would you think the ADA would say that it would be a reasonable accommodation to consider a disabled employee for placement in one of those...	0
8704210	Well, but does that happen?	1
7976441	Isn't he also going to have to pay the sub in this case if the State is wrong?	1
633766	Not necessarily, Justice Kennedy.	1
8463727	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.	1
2147616	I I don't know, it just struck me in reading the question that it was pretty much limited to whether they were right about whether you could rely on the Hart decision.	0
2075723	The taxpayer here had the opportunity to do that.	0
545911	I think that the... if you read all the opinions in Buckley, the Court still said the State statute would have to pass rigorous First Amendment scrutiny, and that incorporates establishing what the State purpose is of the legislation and whether it's sufficiently important to justify whatever infringement may exist, so it is important to know exactly what Missouri has put forward to justify the legislation.	0
3137968	given that conundrum,	1
1777719	That's right.	0
7160695	[Inaudible]	1
5123683	Isn't there some initial assessment that must be made?	1
3474694	Shouldn't--	1
759414	basis for infal-	1
5461104	And there's a waiting list.	1
4072970	And I'm right in thinking that's your position?	1
4587808	is that...	1
1106157	law?	1
812764	Based on the judge's discretion, that's perfectly okay.	0
2174059	[Laughter]	0
5979472	Yes.	1
5605848	And is it open to us, in the habeas context, to take a narrow view of that?	1
2645488	No.	1
7984679	What this Court...  what the...  this Court specifically said in Howey, because it had nothing to go on.	1
537321	Yes.	0
3139935	We don't understand what you're alleging.	1
8887440	In either event, it... it amounts to a decrease in the amount of evidence necessary to convict.	1
7942059	Okay, so why isn't the sort of thing that US Airways does here, declaring all these jobs open once a quarter, create the kind of thing that US Airways has to consider a vacant position?	1
1332923	But there, there was specific...	0
6312294	The State law does not prohibit that?	1
4417081	And if it's present defendants, how is that consistent with Younger?	1
213558	used specifically  here.	1
6407362	Mr. Bell, a lawyer...	1
1276829	The waiter...	0
1513741	The trial wasn't fair because this atrocious -- allegedly atrocious perjury was committed.	0
145726	That was a trade dress case.	0
4592775	Well, in Bumpers,	1
2024365	I'm asking you what your answer to Justice Ginsburg was, whether you didn't agree whether it was a deceptive contract?	1
4889904	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.	1
7124404	All right.	1
2215829	the so-called parallelism with section nineteen eighty-three actions.	1
3399081	Your Honor, I would say that that sentence --	1
4631853	And what do you rely on?	1
213934	No, the record doesn't tell us.	0
8187081	-- because it goes beyond --	1
2795616	situation, Justice Chief Justice Rehnquist, in which if something is delayed and I think Justice Scalia asked that question.	1
8879610	recommendation of the Master I assume.	1
6740116	precise language, but it contains --	1
6317856	[Laughter]	1
5474517	Well, it isn't usually a dodge.	1
9500771	Would that be a taking of a lot that happens to be only 61 feet wide?	1
3502752	It's...	1
2986542	Can you repeat that 355 what?	1
1076235	The other portion is a matter of xxx interstate commerce.	1
922473	Right.	1
7423727	You should actually be grateful for this--	1
882918	You're saying, then, that when the AEDPA says constitutional right it really means any sort of a right claimed under a Federal statute?	1
4748488	Yes, but as Justice Scalia has pointed out, it did amend and broaden the preemption provision at the same time that it banned all advertising in electronic media.	1
7699595	sixteen...	1
5578828	I don't understand what you said.	1
2268583	And so we think that if the officer is able to do a dog sniff within a reasonable time, and still is reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic stop violation, it ought to be constitutionally permissible.	0
1595978	You don't agree?	0
4625045	It will go back to the court of appeals, depending on how we resolve it, to determine whether there was consent.	1
7228976	has trouble --	1
719163	Well, excuse me.	0
1094141	I think your position would require us to basically review and... and reverse Two Pesos.	0
6289300	Amendment rights. It would be an artifice.	1
2228442	And if it is, then you're just wrong about it being only a defensive maneuver.	0
442754	From your perspective.	0
1434404	All -- all of those questions would be -- once the stop is finished, then he should be allowed to go no matter what the question was.	0
4080254	It's a very indirect way for the Congress to accomplish that objective, it seems to me.	1
5683305	Right.	1
5847670	--What's wrong about warning the public about who may be dangerous?	1
872391	[Inaudible]	1
7462729	Now assume, for the sake of argument, that we don't accept the analysis for purposes of Federal equal protection.	1
6917069	who had not been convicted of crimes and who had not been placed on probation.	1
708197	Was it well established that engaged in commerce was narrower than Congress' full power?	0
8953417	Physically occupied all 35?	1
7280954	--Right.	1
5271352	--But they're just as indeterminate.	1
1600137	Well, the... the question of which standard applies I thought was before the Court.	0
581285	Well, do you... do you... understood in order to win under an equal protection argument, do you have to apply some sort of heightened scrutiny?	0
2338323	That the employer had no remedial scheme in place or what is it?	0
1191249	Congress...	1
1776380	Without a statute that uses the word shall enforce.	0
762882	[Inaudible]	1
7932600	Well, what do you make of Professor Davenport's proposal to capitalize the contingency fee as a transaction?	1
1449443	--anywhere down the line until the district court, was it?	0
6591698	Well, how does some liberty interest and reputation survive the Paul versus Davis case?	1
3532284	Well, you know, the concern we ought to have with your approach is we're going to get into some very tricky questions if we go your route in deciding what's testimonial, and why buy a pig in a poke, in effect?	1
2753438	And all of a sudden they're telling us that that's more stringent than a substantial evidence standard.	1
1222328	Well, is there some burden on the part of the prosecutor and the court to consider at least alternative restraints or measures to make sure that there's no misbehavior?	0
1304872	But unfortunately, the record has been destroyed.	0
4477526	Now, what would constitute a retroactive application of each one of those three is quite different.	1
9102136	and say...	1
1223411	Mr. Cross, would you explain to us what it is in California... what is the system and the time within which post-conviction relief can be applied for in California courts?	0
1269318	I think you've clarified that, that if you're dealing with a universe that's all public schools, your argument is still the same, no State action.	1
2628427	So then I think it comes down to, do we do it on a proportional basis, or do you do it on a, well, if it's substantially mixed in, you lose?	1
8083863	criminal law.	1
1094505	cable companies...	0
8443892	I don't know that that affords any basis for going down... back to the design of an entire project, instead of looking as to whether the particular waters here were in fact flood waters.	1
6925793	work out.	1
751156	Well, so that's what we're quibbling about, some description of issues that aren't even arguable.	0
1447398	we we can...	1
1726329	And what...	1
8237100	close to...	1
3828452	legislators have passed.	1
4867014	activity.	1
2146638	Because I mean that's what I'm trying to get a response to.	1
6375595	What I was about to say is that to the extent that you change the requirement and allow it to be speculative, the more speculative you can be, the less likely you're required to comply with the securities laws.	1
7843700	expectations.	1
4583543	Do you think that those findings are somehow false, or not relevant in some way, or that the discrimination is just not unconstitutional, or what?	1
2954508	No.	1
1349577	Yes, all right.	0
7722482	Was he wrong?	1
1373861	We also know that it doesn't impose it doesn't violate any independent scope limitation on traffic stops.	0
3907110	[Laughter]	1
5814487	If you...	1
2464003	competent to assist his lawyers. There's a difference there.	1
1886662	Sorry.	1
8676315	Well, let me ask you about this precise thing.	1
4684907	I mean, true in terms of money, it's the fees.	1
8953269	And how does that fit in with the description you just gave of... about the evidence?	1
5786987	None of those material facts were part of the record.	1
2149116	--that's different from the ordinary taxpayer?	0
8315159	Let me make the question a little more precise. Does the seriousness of the offense weigh into the analysis at all in your view?	1
7596786	Before the adoption of this amendment?	1
2710425	yeah but any   DSM --	1
949541	There's simply no...	1
2437792	Unless they change their rationale, there is no question, as I understand it, on the basis of this opinion what the result will be.	1
474237	[Laughter]	1
7378954	Now, that it seems to me is what the government's argument boils down to, and they're saying we never know about these corruption things or the appearance, but the difference between fifty families and a thousand families is as good as any.	1
5638908	Okay, thank you.	1
1612037	The dog is different because the dog is not a task related -- what the courts have accepted as related to a traffic stop.	0
1183692	think that the practice around the country of various towns and cities is to require permits for people to go door to door in residential areas? I think I even live in a community that probably does that.	1
2429949	Brady and its progeny require f- disclosure only when necessary to ensure a fair trial.	1
4704919	--This form says, state the reasons, and leaves blank space to do that.	1
116257	Also, the probation officer stated in the probation report that he would get 15 years to life.	0
7733913	For example, returning to the Chief's hypothetical, if this were a group of principals meeting not to make an award to a student for diligence, but were meeting to set the curriculum that would be used in all the schools within the association.	1
5491939	There was no preemption law in the twenties either, was there?	1
4364896	It certainly would go to whether a death penalty should be given.	1
40099	But you agree that it's... that it's not jurisdictional with regard to... to an attorney?	1
45861	But on the test.	0
2695701	correct, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
8313861	I understand that, but my understanding of the Government tells me that in that case it is attributable to the month in which it was paid, and I'm trying to find out what--	1
8176564	was...	1
5985351	They're taxed differently.	1
4242519	think that the fact...	1
3288269	There was not a stay and abeyance used here.	1
5743384	Well, I...	1
6614324	They... they, in fact, were there and subpoenas had issued.	1
1279841	who is a citizen or subject of a foreign State, or whether an in- or whether a corporation in this instance is a citizen or subject? Is that a Federal law question?	0
1300845	prosecution.	1
5252231	So the danger is that contributors to political parties are using those contributions to somehow corrupt the candidates?	1
3019718	This is all...	1
1994372	Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.	1
2953092	But it's a totally... you know, if you simply don't file a notice of appeal from the judgment of the district court, the case is over.	1
2969940	But I mean, it can't be that... I mean, it can't be that narrow, so what is it about the content that could be better targeted to children than simply the content of cigarette advertising which gives, tries to give the message that it's a nice and sophisticated thing to smoke?	1
2549081	Does the record tell us if there are any private, substantially equivalent league which is... well, any league which is made up of all private schools which is substantially equivalent?	1
5728018	why the government...	1
8626360	[Laughter]	1
4026548	[Laughter]	1
591123	Yes, Your Honor, it is.	0
2842940	And does it matter here that apparently, and we are told, and I gather without contradiction, that it was the tribe that prompted this agreement?	1
5349223	Well, it was--	1
2420816	Sure it is.	1
2270632	Suppose I accept that I know that I think we know that particular statement--	1
904553	I have never seen... you say any government other than an Indian tribe government could make this argument.	1
4408509	And when you put all those together, where do you go?	1
1746036	Well, how about Mitchell II?	0
5902546	But am I correct then... maybe I don't have the facts right in my mind.	1
4703984	But it does in other respects.	1
4243307	Did you... was there an inflationary factor added so that the damages, say for the early sixties were computed in 1995 or year 2000 dollars?	1
5113733	Yes.	1
4166605	Mr. Denvir, in this case it does seem that the Ninth Circuit just didn't apply the Strickland standard in judging this...	1
972519	There's...	1
6514291	fund shall be given to an agency,	1
1637052	And...	1
8742235	yeah but any   DSM --	1
5042903	Mr. Bell, wouldn't that be, wouldn't that be...	1
9213311	And it turns out... do you concede that that was, in fact, not a lawful grounds for arrest?	1
4733333	Well, he can practice it, but he practices it at a price.	1
337565	In other words, don't want to make them mad.	1
6760069	And yet the... the trial judge herself said to defense counsel, aren't you going to move for a continuance, when this bullet came... was unearthed after all that time.	1
922132	Now, how was that lump sum used?	0
91678	Is that right?	1
6974534	In 20 years, it's still going to be enormously costly.	1
1494558	But it's an entirely different question as to whether requirements concerning the requirements for appeal are being applied retroactively so long as you apply them to cases that are not yet on appeal, and I think that's what's going on here, and it seems to me not at all contrary to Lindh to say that the requirements for appealing are governed by the new law.	1
7847106	fifteen...	1
2128590	Thank you, Ms. Bunn.	1
4682156	say, does...	1
687841	Well, what... what--	0
399943	Well, that's what I'm trying to press you on a little bit, because the findings in some instances are in areas that are under traditional State control.	0
4590055	Mr. Denvir, in this case it does seem that the Ninth Circuit just didn't apply the Strickland standard in judging this...	1
7502245	Well, then there isn't this distinction between representative and non-representative parties.	1
233098	But certainly the other interpretation is a reasonable one as well, in which case it becomes evidence that predominantly they were trying to put together a district that had predominantly black voters in it.	1
4574247	--in all those years.	1
1617365	going...	1
9416298	That's what mechanic's liens are for.	1
3394393	of Congress' choice under the Commerce Clause power to regulate exclusively the States.	1
1209647	--on which we granted cert?	0
8426512	Yes, but that's the question here.	1
8553015	Right?	1
7924152	Well, I thought at its core it was about this rule that the Ninth Circuit adopted about closely related offenses.	1
1131259	the court of appeals...	1
2868923	--You say the control is by governmental institution, and the principal of the school goes to this... sits on this board, or belongs to the... by reason of the fact he's a principal.	1
7740990	And we don't know how much because it hasn't been determined?	1
1909295	All right.	1
1640267	I I mean, I mean, you know it...	1
6614446	I would have thought the health would be a lot better if we just said no pollutants.	1
1784984	And I'm not sure that I understand, under your test, how that fourth prong would be applied or if it's still part of the test.	1
4169582	And... and this wasn't evidence that was under lock and key.	1
8301413	To 2010, it's still the 1990 standard?	1
2962348	The fees have been paid, contrary to what counsel has just told us.	1
1113207	or was it just the three special issues?	1
2461114	--where... where Dow just says the federally mandated statement is included on my label and it's true?	1
2254756	Well, now wait a minute--	0
578603	And it says that if there's an assigned miner and the operator goes out of business in any given year, then that assigned miner becomes part of the pool.	0
4875281	Well, do you think it provided rational basis as the foundation of review in Cleburne?	1
9047111	All right.	1
430298	I don't...	1
3345571	Mr....  Justice Scalia, if it's the same kind of transaction where I...  I'm going to buy this payphone, lease it back to me, I'm going to have a management contract, and you're going to make a lot of money, the fact that it's one person, this Court's jurisprudence says does not make it not that...  does not make it not an investment contract.	1
7032796	Tell me which of our cases, since the Roberts decision, would have come out differently under your proposed approach.	1
3410937	[Laughter]	1
546543	Well, that's not true.	1
6727140	It's not out of his own pocket, is it, the principal, when he goes to the board it's on State time, or municipal time, whoever hires him?	1
4743604	The state denied that, did it not?	1
5808651	Well I just I hope you will address that because if he actually did something but it was somehow inadequate assistance, then perhaps Strickland is the test.	1
1652679	What is that requirement?	0
956894	So I don't think we should look at the fact that he said that later in resolving the case.	0
9001413	[Inaudible]	1
5089898	You didn't file it in writing.	1
3367056	And those rights...	1
3599535	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
7392937	Yeah.	1
3491299	Yeah, but who would have thought that the legislature was leaving open the date for change by the court?	1
9295333	Let me ask you something else.	1
9296001	I think Lebron is not so much in point because there was a lot of top-down governmental delegation there that is different than in this case, precise delegation from the legislature, Pennsylvania and Evans, much closer.	1
7926491	Mr. Jones, you have 2 minutes remaining.	1
889963	about...	1
3546414	Which which it's well go ahead.	1
5559155	Another thing that has to be explained away is, is the E-mail, Cohen to Cooper, as part of the legislative exchange which refers to Greensboro black, that portion of Greensboro at one of the two ends of this salamander, and referring to those districts from Greensboro as simply Greensboro black.	1
1720639	think that the fact...	1
2282286	Why should we strain to find otherwise--	1
2113071	The tax is measured by the wages they pay or are deemed to have paid their employees.	0
3221463	What is your example?	1
1712503	Whether the--	0
1328171	Right.	1
7856220	I assume that there could be a constitutional violation in a Government turning over its determination of who will play in intramural sports to an organization that is not providing due process, or to an organization that discriminates on the basis of race, but that's not the argument that you're making here, that it's improper for the schools to deal with this organization.	1
6900211	Well I just I hope you will address that because if he actually did something but it was somehow inadequate assistance, then perhaps Strickland is the test.	1
1358203	In August, that water would normally be released into the San Joaquin bed, and now it isn't released to the San Joaquin bed, why, for irrigation purposes, 100 percent.	1
1808446	Right.	1
4966218	The statute has to be narrowly tailored, we contend, but at least closely drawn to pursue the Federal interest.	1
8737438	What this...  could the factors that this Court used in the Reves...	1
4815739	May I answer as you go?	1
2296620	That's why we think there needs some leeway for the officers to take some time to pursue -- to pursue the things that they observe.	0
3379037	Ms. Harbury, may I ask you...	1
3154495	Rule specifically on the personal individual immunity?	1
9238756	And I I s- suppose...	1
893380	They dig up some good claim, and now you previously said they have a lot of discretion on the prejudgment interest part.	1
42600	No, we're not saying that.	1
8285584	Take this case.	1
3870916	Why not look...	1
4393642	when service is to...	1
1575833	But why isn't any evidence in... in one case or the other in the hypothetical I put?	1
86152	Because this is the fear that some of them might be.	1
9260598	Because I mean that's what I'm trying to get a response to.	1
1116367	Well, even in areas where it's already against the law to have materials that are obscene or harmful to minors?	0
77714	But that's not at issue here.	0
3580082	Well, there are two people violating...	1
5781608	Is it... that's on the page... the page with the photograph says what the crime was?	1
5621281	--I'm not sure that I know how it would apply in this very case, however.	1
7927155	Here, because there's no give, it does have a punitive feel.	1
1106383	I'm...	1
6409034	speak...	1
7257212	They --	1
9026063	Because of the error in scoring?	1
7955247	Well, it might make it necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't any.	1
9586340	[Laughter]	1
3268453	The discrete situation?	1
1873300	suspicion?	1
2030118	Well, again, if I -- if -- the formal -- the formal handing of the ticket is not the end, in your example, Your Honor?	0
7018920	Well, maybe you... maybe you should tell us later, and proceed.	1
1942584	--Yes.	1
402647	one on one...	1
1076436	And is it clear under State law that the school could adopt whatever provisions it wants for its opening of the school?	0
5088534	But the National Education Association can run that very same phone bank with totally unregulated money today.	1
1468034	Suppose a state has a school voucher program such as the Court indicated could be upheld in the Zelman case.	1
2344575	But it's also the case that the Congress under the statute that you're defending forces exactly the type of indirect support that Justice Scalia has just described instead of having it out in the open where everybody knows who is supporting who and who is paying money for whom.	1
9190134	Well, they might change their mind in the future.	1
6690004	Thank you, Mr. Minear.	1
4757136	--One concern is that, in the prison situation, the prison is exerting control over all aspects of the prisoner's daily life.	1
7659306	Why aren't the farmers' losses part of the loss to the general economy?	1
8959924	Well, Ms. Percival, would you still be here today with this argument if the defendant had simply had shackles around his ankles that would have prevented him, in... in effect, from running or lunging at anyone, but that that had been concealed by appropriate covers around the table where he was sitting so that the jury was unaware of that situation?	1
274619	But even on your kind of worst case argument, I think the government's response is that's what Congress wanted, and Congress has reserved to itself the power to interfere in the process.	1
2893351	And also, there there is undoubtedly a State law cause of action in negligence that would lie against both the employee and the employer under respondeat superior.	1
8790880	Mm-hmm.	1
3200988	Right.	1
3445597	Now at this level you max out again.	1
6316824	Yes.	1
4971042	But -- this...	1
268242	Have you said all you want to say about qualified immunity?	0
1107553	--and the officer is reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic mission.	0
8289107	These are just like... there are... all rules and regulations they pronounce after... if you prevail will be State rules.	1
1286519	I thought they were all in the same boat.	0
2761561	as long as we have an adequate...	1
3477726	going to do?	1
4653855	But what's the rationale for this scheme it does have, which just seems to go beyond what California is authorized to do?	1
2189485	Mr. Zwerling, would the prosecutor have been entitled to a jury instruction that the jury could draw an adverse inference by virtue of the fact...  as to guilt by virtue of the fact that the defendant had sat in the courtroom the whole time?	0
1841654	Well, it just... it's hard to know how to define inherently distinctive.	0
1394131	So the danger is that contributors to political parties are using those contributions to somehow corrupt the candidates?	1
1202090	That's not Russello at all.	1
1951578	--which yours don't do.	0
7657478	The statute has to be narrowly tailored, we contend, but at least closely drawn to pursue the Federal interest.	1
6786768	Well, do you represent Mr. Hicks?	1
9209981	--That's right, broader.	1
1326390	Well, of course, the United States can, but what you're saying here is, it's not the State.	1
5909458	And you say the Secretary has exercised it just by providing the funds, whether or not any particular review is made?	1
9228135	Every claim like that would end up in court under some kind of constitutional analysis.	1
3310993	Well--	1
1950365	And all of that is in this notice... who is appealing, what he's appealing, and who he's appealing to.	1
5328468	So I could file a sheet of paper with no name on it and I've filed a proper appeal.	1
8318263	information.	1
2912398	Well, General Waxman, certainly in theory a State could provide adequate remedies for violation and could, indeed, apply correctly Federal patent law in doing so, could they not?	1
1911194	Thank you.	0
2742846	--Mr. Dreeben, you seem to be... the Government's position seems to be somewhat of a shifting target.	1
4477029	Mr. Everett, we'll hear from you.	1
2444591	Well, are you dealing with active inducement as just a theoretical add-on, or is that a satisfactory way to resolve this case?	1
486458	our...	1
2279698	Now, should we make any allowance here?	0
3999399	[Laughter]	1
6369426	does it...	1
9267096	--in the Federal habeas context, the AEDPA law suggests there's a great premium paid... at stake for promptly resolving these things.	1
6429925	ninety-one.	1
185011	Let's just make that assumption.	1
5781035	Compulsion, that's the language in the amendment.	1
7846354	I mean, after all, case can mean different things in a different context.	1
8206500	But this... this scheme does something else, it seems to me.	1
2531121	With respect to...	1
7512777	--We could unify it the way that you don't want.	1
2575059	Let me make the question a little more precise. Does the seriousness of the offense weigh into the analysis at all in your view?	1
1484480	It just strikes me as rather odd that the claimant wouldn't want to raise them.	0
9206610	We don't... we don't have the figures on that.	1
405956	Thank you, Mr. Davidson.	1
5074376	Well, then how... why not... Answer the implied question from Justice Gin... can a court say the notice of appeal must be in writing and have it jurisdictional?	1
4305320	Well...	1
6167801	mean,	1
5987280	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.	1
5774999	so on and so...	1
3585703	Oh, yes, there is and it was a tax case.	1
9361071	necessarily.	1
3094257	That's right, and what Lindh involved was the substantive requirements for habeas, and it said this would be retroactive if you applied the new substantive requirements to a case already filed.	1
8663066	It doesn't refer to whether it's a statute or a common law case.	1
4336026	She couldn't have -- could not have...	1
2450461	Didn't the Ninth Circuit found... find there was no intent to make it punitive, but looked to the effects?	1
9657344	But But...	1
8743884	--Well, that's... that's this CAFC's ruling on its own jurisdiction.	1
3572205	Who is bound, and to what extent, by this MSA?	1
4888505	--Suppose I thought that there were probable--	1
634988	[Laughter]	1
2317631	Well, the fact that the counsel may have used this in his summation doesn't really go to the harmless error question, if there's a whole lot of other evidence as to future dangerousness.	1
2697378	Okay.	1
1251189	Before it had ever gone to trial, to a jury?	0
232684	But it... but the point is--	0
1187649	Yes.	0
6755334	But why wouldn't the principal, when he or she goes to the meeting and casts a vote, it seems to me that that principal, when he or she casts a vote, must be acting in a State capacity because that's why that principal is there.	1
1149965	Mr. Zwerling, would the prosecutor have been entitled to a jury instruction that the jury could draw an adverse inference by virtue of the fact...  as to guilt by virtue of the fact that the defendant had sat in the courtroom the whole time?	0
3473643	Case 2, there has been drilling previously, and the black, solid coal is thereafter removed.	1
5820904	on the credit card...	1
1897784	--who would be available and who would have remedies or standing to bring their claims.	0
8790001	But, the standard forum selection clause?	1
6982122	Well, let... you keep talking about what happened in the past, and I'm... I find some difficulty with that because we're being asked to review a new policy.	1
1590993	question...	1
1571000	that the commission...	0
2105210	[Laughter]	1
6398656	Victimless--	1
8693689	itself...	1
7939964	One of your arguments the first time was that race was predominant because they kept heavily Democratic districts out but they put less Democratic African-American district precincts in, right?	1
7433441	Well, but we now have Milwaukee, that confirms that.	1
1444401	Can it acquiesce in the loss of those rights?	0
8348309	Well, is there a...  but you take the position that it would be proper in every case.	1
8257136	That's something we ought to consider.	1
4940284	Not necessarily.	1
2036073	So whatever you're proposing, you think the CADC correctly employed in that case?	0
4719699	Does this record have any statistics or figures on how often these no...  these Wende briefs are filed in California, percentage wise?	1
1011158	you know posel- I  I...	1
9397912	more deference...	1
2296834	impede a lawsuit.	1
6155846	Okay.	1
5471011	Is that your position?	1
871689	And is all of that land practicably irrigable as the...  the cases deal with that term, all 25,000 acres, or some smaller portion of it?	1
1200929	I mean, the courts have applied a reasonableness analysis to routine traffic stops for 30 years.	0
7691319	I mean,	1
3076510	How could Colorado have known about prejudgment interest in an interstate compact dispute?	1
2304829	The indications are it's not.	1
1630265	--the O'Brien test?	0
1938227	I don't think that...	1
8861154	Who--	1
8940913	Is that because of the notion of accommodation principles?	1
8982117	Well, the things that make it look like an investment contract in this context is that the individual is putting himself, his money, into an enterprise that is being, in this case, widely promoted...  as I said, 10...  over 10,000 investors put their money into this enterprise hoping to get some return as a result of the...  the efficiency or effectiveness...	1
6665555	participates.	1
1570738	--by way of a defense.	0
2183319	And it's hard to know from your argument the answer to that.	0
22711	--Yes.	1
1780578	I think the Florida court has sort of ignored that old Boardman case.	0
6253870	there was a section in nineteen ninety-eight passed by Congress, section thirty-four fourteen of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act providing that im- IRS would not threaten a taxpayer audit to coerce the taxpayer into entering a tip-reporting alternative commitment agreement, so at least Congress acknowledged...	1
1569506	If we were dealing with a private individual rather than a corporation, do you think there c- could be a stateless person who wouldn't fit under this stat-?	0
1046928	But the courts made up those forms, no?	1
7620438	Thank...	1
1560947	All right.	0
5528532	I mean, let them fall where they may.	1
1507125	Well, I'm just trying to find out how it works, whether it's like a voucher program, you give the money to the student and the student decides how to use it.	0
1362941	Counsel, it... it looks like the instruction to the jury said that a defendant may only be found guilty of the conspiracy charged in the indictment if he joined the conspiracy at a time when it was possible to achieve the objective of that conspiracy.	0
99439	FICA...	1
168648	So, the real real significance of the...	1
923713	You're saying, well, it's not intuitively sound because we have no examples of what would go on if I won the case.	1
7885334	We...	1
6880854	And the tribal court declined to what?	1
3068925	I would like to know.	1
5488929	The third...	1
4558227	Future defendants?	1
4965225	--I would assume we would accept that finding.	1
662491	But there, there was specific...	0
4096867	--Well, if--	1
9502396	shows that the defendant, in fact, knew, what's the problem?	1
7681787	No, I'm assuming the Corps of Engineers.	1
1641691	In a trial situation it can usually be assumed that the defendant does want to continue the litigation.	0
2460347	Was that not a waiver of this claim?	1
3981263	that don't have the Con-	1
8773793	Mr. Chief Justice, it's true that... that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is... would constitute cause for failing to raise the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at... on direct appeal, that that is also true in... with all other substantive claims, that ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to raise any substantive claim at the time of direct appeal could constitute cause excusing the default, yet this Court has continued to apply procedural default principles in the case of other substantive claims, and so I'm not sure that that particular consideration tips the balance decidedly in one direction or the other.	1
196362	And -- but that is past the -- that is past the traffic stop.	0
2558982	I mean, people from Kansas never go to Colorado?	1
6856665	It's pretty high-handed, don't you think?	1
2833162	And I think the dog doesn't bark, he just alerts.	1
7666996	Now, you say that's just shorthand for those portions of Greensboro that were reliably Democratic.	1
6924881	do anything. It's not like a complaint.	1
3079456	Well, then how... why not... Answer the implied question from Justice Gin... can a court say the notice of appeal must be in writing and have it jurisdictional?	1
7441777	It was... something was called second and successive, and it wasn't.	1
3935182	It covers welfare as well as health?	1
3502507	Well, I guess you'd like your client out of jail?	1
8405590	Under the jurisdictional--	1
3785906	Unilaterally?	1
8147969	Yes.	1
6987811	that even if...	1
9513994	But is there any which is a pure rational basis in an economic area?	1
868021	It could mean that.	1
1867172	Right.	0
310983	In fact, they rejected them.	1
6971427	consid-  if it's...	1
36201	consensus.	1
1309807	Do you want us to reverse that?	0
7148168	Right.	1
69628	And... and the Hadix suit is one where there is still an ongoing monitoring?	0
1756576	Got it?	1
9579245	It may end at the water's edge.	1
7053729	Do you know when that started?	1
818724	in the statutory...	1
1049891	Is that the majority view of lower courts today?	0
6064787	Mr. Hood, don't you have a law--	1
5960350	One... one line that I... I think there is respondents seek to establish in this case is that this information has to be generated by acts that occur after the conviction.	1
1807319	Now assume, for the sake of argument, that we don't accept the analysis for purposes of Federal equal protection.	1
5102064	[Laughter]	1
2114389	So that is a scenario -- that that can occur.	0
7985104	things that you...	1
1112708	Yes, but... against its consent.	1
5890457	we dealing with here? You don't have much time, and I am concerned.	1
2374227	Justice Souter, they're not live action. That's the difference.	1
8123256	But isn't that... you have gone, I think, a lot farther than you need to go.	1
1243429	That's why you're here.	1
1513134	Well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the Government actually will have available to spend?	0
4351146	Well, is...  isn't this a fruits case?	1
8633825	--Okay.	1
3876401	Let's assume they don't.	1
3169163	--your pitch.	1
7434241	have here we have we have here an antisocial personality disorder.	1
1352688	The formal test is when the mission has been accomplished.	0
3121572	from now.	1
6527967	Well, that was...	1
4097475	Wasn't there also a request for funds?	1
1897402	You mean the first degree burglary conviction--	0
5376021	Well, basically what the...	1
8361122	The statute, which is extraordinarily broad, says note, stock, treasury stock, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, mineral rights, straddle, option.	1
3527188	Well, quite apart from the proper construction of the statute, one would hope it's not likely that Congress intended to transfer from what would otherwise be review in the court of appeals to direct review in this Court.	1
9390965	But it's not the kind...	1
8459298	Would you explain to me...	1
3528708	Yes.	1
628127	I mean, to apply R.A.V. is to extend R.A.V.--	0
6617839	People comply.	1
1673041	There is --	1
9629260	"""If you find there any mitigating circumstances in this case. """	1
1804935	hear that in response to the question.	0
2373011	That's circular.	1
96602	Right.	1
3302920	--that's terrible drafting.	1
1428550	Isn't that correct?	1
8565086	Yes.	1
7364337	I mean, we're not going to upset it unless it's clearly erroneous.	1
1771135	Yes.	0
3522832	It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market.	1
7986631	Is that right?	1
8045333	Well, I I...	1
1210076	there is.	1
2335396	Surely it's not in the statute that there must be a cost/benefit analysis.	1
1568609	[Inaudible]	1
4655273	we're talking -- What we're talking about here is is sentencing...	1
3013306	Do you support that analogy?	1
1873227	of it...	1
2353084	I mean, you certainly wouldn't be complaining if they taxed racetracks at a combined rate of 15 percent or... or a combined rate of... of 30 percent for that matter.	1
1548598	Yes.	0
8328627	But in today's world, the figures, the statistics are staggering about how many narcotics are brought into our country by way of the use of gas tanks.	1
411204	Well if if...	1
146544	Just in just as a general proposition.	1
4501371	so,	1
319630	purposes.	1
5361318	They're... they... or they are special extensions--	1
7529982	And there is some suggestion in our cases that other claims ought to be addressed before resorting to that, such as inadequate assistance of counsel.	1
8644260	That doesn't say, talk about health.	1
1807288	Now try it and speak up, if you...	0
1550503	Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate?	0
2667031	They make the... they make the inference that there's... that there's a hazard here, a risk they don't want to take.	1
3581543	They may have given different reasons, but four have said that the States' authority has not been taken away from them by the Federal Government.	1
8890617	Does that influence our interpretation at all?	1
2255409	If you don't like the terms, don't enter into it.	1
767256	And maybe that conveys some notion, in addition to not alienating it, not laying waste to it.	0
447353	that it...	0
1438704	Well, what financial interests do your clients have to keep litigating today in another court?	0
8326946	And it is, I think, somewhat unusual that in the strange circumstances of their disappearance, that there wouldn't be some small amount of time given to find out what had happened.	1
3145512	I don't see it either. I'm looking at page --	1
6872680	Mr. McAllister,	1
1875984	Absolutely. If...	1
3754491	And if the State complied with the new policy, what is your complaint with that?	1
3285455	But haven't State regulators changed the common law in that regard with unitization and that sort of thing, so that you no longer can, even if the common law allows you, simply drill straight down and drain your neighbor's pool?	1
8088053	Sometimes some employees will be helped, sometimes others will be hurt, sometimes... you know, who knows, and therefore you don't have this overriding statutory goal to get the backwards allocation.	1
3402969	Mr. Minear, where do we find the best map showing the boundaries of the land in question?	1
2244939	It enables the municipal employers and officials to review it, to investigate, and to preserve records.	0
1132081	, but I can't...	1
792654	This Court said in Bagley that Brady's primary purpose is not to d- d- as- Brady's purpose is not to displace the adversary system as the primary means by which truth is un- as the primary means by which truth is uncovered.	1
1679646	That, in fact, involved pretrial deprivations -- deprivations of right up to the time of trial.	0
5678624	Then... then what was the effect of the Frazer case?	1
1871527	That ceased, did it not, the review?	1
7453574	It...	1
6598385	[Laughter]	1
2335918	she she she...	1
9079408	Could you read it to us?	1
358648	Perhaps I misunderstood.	1
1257267	But then you're saying it has to be Federal authority, the FTC, and the FDA, at the time they thought they might regulate nicotine as a drug--	1
7333812	but it's not.	1
6189742	All right.	1
3733083	That is -- Your Honor...	1
682792	--Hawaiian citizens?	1
5990225	is that it?	1
9285046	But you... you don't seem to mention our holding in Saffle v. Parks which was a much harder, closer case in my view about whether it was dictated by Lockett than your case.	1
1595816	As a tip? I I seem to recall seeing a...	1
602707	We're just saying we can't touch the political process unless you get yourself into a suspect class.	1
7195842	is a collateral attack, the employee says, look, I filed a grievance and it's pending, what then is the burden of proof by the Government employer?	1
7502927	All right.	1
1962392	Handing of the ticket is not the end-all.	0
8015255	He says that additionally, the evidence shows that the more heavily Democratic precincts are bypassed, i.e. they're out, in favor of the more heavily African-American, which are in.	1
5844913	Is that preempted or not in your view?	1
4829213	Did you address, on behalf of Stumpf, some allegation that he has to be resentenced?	1
6421881	The and a...	1
1702559	require a...	1
6781650	Was that ever challenged at trial?	1
8418698	In fact, in your brief in opposition you said, although probable cause existed, and the police, so forth, so on.	1
9122490	Because I would think your position might lead to the conclusion that that doesn't even set out the elements of a complete offense.	1
9638331	I know that the Torres establishes law, but I don't know that any of the others say that you can't cure a defect.	1
8614564	So... so it wouldn't apply at all here.	1
3733335	That's what we're talking about.	1
806566	Mr. Lamken, I guess what respondents really want is preenforcement review of the regulations.	0
2153723	But I don't understand why you don't answer Justice Ginsburg's question directly.	0
1796185	This... this... your client I guess was convicted of several counts.	0
5763792	So at least we are... what is called into question is a uniform, consistently followed practice for five or six decades.	1
7482820	Is it in the joint appendix?	1
5695021	Why didn't Fox renew the copyright if they wanted to do that?	1
2741279	The red brief, in page two?	1
1996851	I know.	1
5951535	the individual employees. And...	1
3813951	Isn't that your problem?	1
625361	after the comment because...	1
350325	Why?	0
8556636	That is correct.	1
1436392	So what's your answer?	1
458073	I'm sorry, Chief.	1
509316	Too bad.	1
9596206	because they wouldn't have to -- The only problem...	1
5095906	But doesn't that mean your client should have to put forward some evidence establishing a material issue of disputed fact on that point?	1
5948411	Thank you, Mr. Garre.	1
4116699	But it... the statute, though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's fees, isn't it?	1
8263726	Well, I don't know.	1
7377290	teacher recording and making...	1
149232	Where are we?	1
404811	Well, is there a Federal issue if the Court doesn't--	1
7716558	and I doubt that -- that it applies to --	1
5361408	323(a) prohibits the solicitation, receipt, direction, transfer and spending.	1
8204464	Does Brentwood's coach have to be a full-time employee of the Board of Education, as you understand it?	1
7408376	What what were those...	1
269606	--based on the information that they had?	1
2462754	Is there no post conviction proceeding in Virginia for newly discovered evidence?	1
756690	I--	1
9229049	But I thought that was the whole basis that you've just given in your answer to justify what happened here.	1
8919108	What do you think we should do with this case?	1
9475645	not need that.	1
1328057	But, a Tribal Court wouldn't occur to me.	1
7800561	So how do you fit yourself within that provision?	1
1392876	Well, do you agree with that?	1
1117230	Could you point me to places in the record where it supports your position on the use of the visible restraint?	0
3873484	Well, they might change their mind in the future.	1
2061636	situation, Justice Chief Justice Rehnquist, in which if something is delayed and I think Justice Scalia asked that question.	1
9652975	the same. That C and D provision-	1
8081982	So we don't have to get tangled up in this other business, do we?	1
8126941	Yeah, and one of their charges was possession, was it not?	1
5610191	Well, I suppose we'd have to decide here not only whether it was per se invalid, but whether it was reasonable under any other standard.	1
2345035	Well, it's clear we didn't.	0
448837	but deeming in the other direction occurred.	1
1246565	for their...	1
3975262	Because...	1
4154326	[Laughter]	1
1179238	[Laughter]	1
9416098	Your brief reads to me... at about page 15... to suggest that you're proposing a broad rule that probable cause exists to arrest all occupants of a car anytime commercial quantities of narcotics are found in the passenger portion of the car.	1
2387980	But that gets me back to my question.	0
7534859	[Inaudible]	1
8120262	Mr. Draper, why--	1
1103512	Subsection B --	1
874069	Well, I'm just trying to find out how it works, whether it's like a voucher program, you give the money to the student and the student decides how to use it.	0
2075510	--for a State to tax--	1
707390	Is this something that is commonly done by Federal prosecutors, to your knowledge?	1
4127851	So the respondent has been paid in full, under this contract?	1
1196995	Certainly the Restatement and the view of some of the amici is contrary to yours on this.	0
9148954	Well, there is no clear statutory rule requirement that it be signed.	1
8602876	Mr. Anaya, we've gotten pretty far afield, I think, from what we have to resolve in this case, possibly, and there is remaining, as I understand it, a suit by Mr. Hicks against a state official in his individual capacity.	1
5518359	Are you disputing those figures or not?	1
915148	There are few grounds for challenging the plea and the resulting sentence.	0
1314641	So, typically...	1
6749485	What... what is... what provisions of the Constitution specifically are you looking to?	1
5498930	As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a small farmer.	1
3159493	A $100 donation solicited by the chairman of the RNC to a California gubernatorial candidate is not prohibiting that, making that a felony, is not closely drawn.	1
1158887	--The courts -- courts asserted--	0
5049010	up.	1
7788376	Isn't that true?	1
3293904	The Kansas Supreme Court appeared to hold that a person must be completely unable to control his behavior in order to meet what it thought the constitutional standard is under the due process clause.	1
4905092	I think that's been addressed at considerable length already.	1
1540747	It authorizes and requires the Secretary of the Treasury to make inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.	0
8278728	That's the argument.	1
3572761	That's--	1
16110	Well, if you say that the world we look at is the people using these programs under the Federal law requirements in libraries, then it isn't a public forum.	0
684708	And that is wholly... that is not Federal money.	1
1003711	He's said he isn't going to.	0
892570	First of all, it's not it's not a strict de minimis approach that focuses just on the amount of time in isolation.	0
8382862	rejected the notion.	1
1844480	I would say that the...  it is not as far-reaching as the...  the sense of doom that your question suggested.	1
4051691	Well you're...	1
1274958	Well, again, Your Honor, in this case the defendant got the only term he could have gotten for second degree murder.	0
5623146	On that s- wait...	1
5325562	Okay, but you've also got a finding which you seem to... I think you want to ignore here, that you should have known in '69.	1
1258145	to stop.	1
589249	Mr. Fishbein, are there other State causes of action that your client could pursue that don't raise this problem of having to establish that the FDA called it wrong, a failure to warn, or some other kind of negligence cause of action?	0
3152645	Well, let me ask you about this precise thing.	1
5046568	That's flatly inconsistent with the command in the special issue that because at least ten jurors have a reasonable doubt we must answer no.	1
2639358	It's setting the process in advance.	1
7023286	objecting to a distinction between classes of...	1
4748860	What if we assume that the subcontractor did not violate the law, everything was fine, the State was just in error.	1
3692393	Mr. Chief Justice, it's true that... that ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is... would constitute cause for failing to raise the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel at... on direct appeal, that that is also true in... with all other substantive claims, that ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failing to raise any substantive claim at the time of direct appeal could constitute cause excusing the default, yet this Court has continued to apply procedural default principles in the case of other substantive claims, and so I'm not sure that that particular consideration tips the balance decidedly in one direction or the other.	1
5878367	[Inaudible]	1
224359	but but as you...	1
1658546	Well, then how... why not... Answer the implied question from Justice Gin... can a court say the notice of appeal must be in writing and have it jurisdictional?	1
1733662	I would answer that in two ways .	1
1589323	But wouldn't that have given the courts a chance to go directly to the issue of whether the statute is constitutional?	0
5475856	This is written in terms of purpose, so whether it's intent, or purpose, or motive, treat them the same.	1
5688416	Okay, but in answer to my question, are you taking the view that we can leave that the way it is and calculate benefits--	1
559315	And... and it's hard to justify, under this statute, finding a cause of action before there's any damage or if there isn't any.	0
1448467	Well, whose--	0
4278121	Is that correct?	1
5417804	Okay.	1
5329121	Well, James, as the Chief Justice indicated, didn't apply to a system where we had irrigation facilities.	1
2954323	In this case--	1
1554455	They said, you shall revise standards every 5 years, and that's their general provision.	1
3908991	Nothing will get us out from under this demeaning regime, that much more than the burden of going to a police station, that that's what it's about, that we're locked into this for life and it has a devastating effect on our lives.	1
9154994	Yes.	1
6351347	And the court below, I guess, didn't resolve that.	1
6029980	I don't see how that should affect our determination.	1
367617	Humphrey Bogart.	1
3060567	I just thought it was a little curious that if some means of solving this had been offered, why we're here.	1
2672683	The contingence fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by the recovery on--	1
1757500	And can we not address that?	0
6608558	I don't know whether he runs into problems under Roberts, because what Roberts as I have read the opinion objects to is the capriciousness, the fact that the jury could act with no evidence at all.	1
6340790	So that seems to me the most logical reading of this provision, that it's talking about what is your basic habeas claim.	1
1283738	All the things that you mentioned would come into play.	1
8358688	can...	1
1310124	[Laughter]	1
233630	What was being discussed in McCleskey was a constitutional right, so it makes perfectly good sense there to talk about... that language wasn't intended to cover the whole scope of habeas.	1
7914275	The courts just don't review it.	1
1036510	So Mr. Phillips was right, then, in his statement to me that there had been no technological change during that period of time.	1
324957	That's an 11-minute traffic stop.	0
7158339	Thank you, Mr. Brands.	1
4705829	That is the allegation, and that's a conclusionary information and belief, easy to allege, hard to disprove allegation that can be made in every one of these cases.	1
157598	It all depends on what... what the other factors involved are, and here--	1
412359	other...	1
2938795	Your...	1
4830427	They must have it.	1
6875501	They held it was a property right in Roth.	1
2596337	Of course, we have... we have so many references to God in our daily lives in this country.	1
6073567	So long as the legislature has a pure intent, it can have as burdensome a regulation as it wants based on previous criminal convictions?	1
6399478	unduly onerous...	1
6995268	Are there... a fairly small number, I would assume?	1
3735401	And only on the grounds that the respondent was not qualified for driving?	1
1451913	But I still don't see how that means that this one sentence is so controlling that all the other evidence of future dangerousness can't be looked at to decide whether it was harmless error.	1
2060777	What's left, if this can stand?	0
1362952	And what would that dollar amount be here?	1
7677178	and...	1
1712664	Even though some other employee on the basis of greater seniority than the respondents under the plan could take that slot?	1
2161016	--based on the information that they had?	1
1677117	And so should we apply that test here to those early statements?	0
3338928	You're saying, then, that when the AEDPA says constitutional right it really means any sort of a right claimed under a Federal statute?	1
7213336	It isn't just Federal money.	1
9366282	Prisons has...	1
3426201	--This is a bit of an aside, but do you know whether any disciplinary proceedings were ever brought against the prosecutors?	1
503831	Why don't you address the ways in which this act goes beyond our former free exercise--	0
2789583	May I ask if...	1
3703442	I mean, it's California's choice to have this scheme, and it's enacted one that does raise concerns of trying to tax extraterritorial income, in effect.	1
3033882	Is it an effects test and how do we apply it--	1
2266936	--The Government said you don't want unnecessary discovery.	0
6878417	Well...	1
7997303	Your Honor.	1
287520	There's no other reason to hold the person after that point in time.	0
2235675	If we tie -- if we tie the traffic ticket as the end of the -- end of the justification for the stop, then we--	0
2783692	And...	1
3890313	Of course, that's true, but in my mind rings a case, in which I was in dissent, but the majority has the law, and that's Hendricks.	1
4240988	But in Salerno and in Hendricks and in these other situations where people are being held and detained, there has been judicial review of that detention order, and there is no such provision here, is there?	1
1343884	I don't think you cited or relied on that DeStefano v. Woods case.	1
2401048	But your corruption rationale is much less if you're talking about a big wheel or, you know, a fat cat donating a lot of money to a candidate, the idea is the fat cat is going to get something in return, but the idea that a political party donating to a candidate is going to get something in return just doesn't have the same ring to it.	1
324716	Okay, but in answer to my question, are you taking the view that we can leave that the way it is and calculate benefits--	1
55961	That's their whole point.	0
8502427	tenancy.	1
4120973	You're going to get to that, whether we compute the losses to the farmers of Kansas from the failure to have more water delivered.	1
172693	So, don't we have to look at what appropriate means in this context?	0
4975813	And this wouldn't be an unusual district if other states linked their major cities with a ribbon in between to make it contiguous?	1
6430194	That's the answer to that question, nothing to do with flood control.	1
9023594	Now, what prevents that from happening, once we get into the habit of awarding prejudgment interest?	1
2743195	Well, I can find it.	1
6920164	If we don't agree with you on the--	1
5472571	No, I'm sorry. If if...	1
4532753	basically correct?	1
8237213	Well, what does the judge do, then, faced with this mixed petition with exhausted and unexhausted claims--	1
2804312	We know today that...	1
1424271	Do you want us to reverse that?	0
671262	The farmers are there, dying for water.	1
167283	Let me ask, in the context of this very case, the officer sought summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue.	0
6276972	If you think gender discrimination cases aren't different, you're just wrong.	1
4175849	And 323(a), as we've indicated, is an across the board criminal ban on national parties accepting any money that is not strictly regulated by FECA.	1
3805141	There might be a third unarticulated, valid reason for the action conceivably.	1
594139	That's why you're here.	1
7694786	conspiracy...	1
8128127	But the legislature has already ignored both of those rules to such a degree that further distortion appears immaterial.	1
1636052	Well, it was this Court's decision in the Williamson County case that led you and I assume other lawyers in these takings cases to return to State court and try to litigate everything.	1
5970552	But the home ownership market, private home ownership market, is a... is one of the foundations of the American economy I suppose.	1
1908415	And the school could say, we're only going to allow after school use for athletic purposes.	1
1640472	Well, is there some burden on the part of the prosecutor and the court to consider at least alternative restraints or measures to make sure that there's no misbehavior?	0
1418728	Mr. Shapiro, can this case, in your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?	0
4191465	--Your claim is an ex post facto claim, a retroactivity claim.	1
93511	It may be more orderly, but it's incorrect.	0
1973273	i- i- with...	1
7240153	--But why isn't the evidence that this is... is a face plastered on the Internet, that in modern times that is the equivalent of the town square where you're shaming the bad actor?	1
3817309	--saying that he doesn't owe it to the subcontractor.	1
6497334	Correct.	1
178596	duration...	1
3793651	The Congress then was giving away public lands and was giving away public minerals.	1
7833594	And as to the...	1
6523291	But did the district court have the power to decide that issue when it had the case in front of it?	1
4676105	on. But the...	1
987681	I... I thought PLRA became effective April 26th, 1996.	0
6766898	And doesn't it go beyond merely an agreement to be subject to a court with jurisdiction or with competent jurisdiction?	1
4216127	[Laughter]	1
769222	All right.	0
868903	"Is that what would be applied if we had to address the consequence here, of holding it to be a ""weighing"" State?"	0
1860214	Can... has the tribe asked, administratively, for the Bureau of Indians Affairs to recognize it now as a tribe?	0
8371360	--Which a mere reference to statement would not do?	1
2750964	Okay.	1
7969726	No, I realize that.	1
4038748	[Laughter]	1
3797737	reliable people who they can trust to follow the rules.	1
6744830	He's relying on... that's why you have an expert witness, to some extent, upon the credibility of the expert witness.	1
7774313	Okay.	1
9060190	What was filed here was a certificate of probable cause, I guess, not a certificate of appealability.	1
3071728	And this is just a regulatory scheme to... to make that information more clear as to how many people are in the community have suffered that conviction.	1
1287712	--not entering a car with intent to commit theft.	0
1027597	That's what we're here to decide I think.	0
6787188	twoA.	1
2386275	It's not as if...	1
4084408	Isn't that really what we're saying?	1
5144878	But aren't you picking one of the two means of finality that's set forth in the earlier provision?	1
6251935	I mean, that was an important governmental interest.	1
4516590	exams...	1
3652328	No.	1
1192476	conspiracy...	1
8518427	How is that situation handled today?	1
2722062	I don't see it either. I'm looking at page --	1
662832	All right.	0
1763110	Well, could you answer my question?	1
6130316	That makes it totally redundant.	1
979749	Right.	0
8922517	Do you take the position that trying to find a witness was some kind of an exigent circumstance here?	1
5893879	The other 10 months, the water, on your theory, is not where it is in the canal because of flood control, and so I think what Justice Souter was driving at, and what I was, if all the water in the canal is causing that damage, what reason would there be for calling the water in those other 10 months flood water and subjecting it to immunity?	1
7855989	Okay.	1
1699322	Maybe ordinary wear and tear isn't covered, but--	0
2027983	And for income tax purposes of the employees, it would be... we're talking back pay.	1
6310021	Well, that doesn't cover that point, but... and I can find it elsewhere, I assume, but let me ask you this.	1
2937340	No, but it's not the Congress now that it was then.	1
1744518	For example, if the claim of ineffectiveness is that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to competently impeach a particular witness, an appellate court could perhaps look at the trial record and determine that the testimony of that particular witness was not central to the prosecution's case, and in those circumstances, could a more effective impeachment have given rise to a reasonable probability that the result at trial would have been different.	1
6267477	[Inaudible]	1
804499	Okay, but the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit did not address the case in... by looking at the evidence and whether a directed verdict should have been given--	0
3227307	I mean, that might be an error...	1
1262930	Oh no.	1
1052676	Now, are there any relevant differences in the text of the two statutes or the regs on this issue?	0
9328637	the the incentives the that...	1

6775203	--Mr. Nagle, I guess at the time that this act was adopted in... what, 1925?	1
7351197	Well, I guess you'd like your client out of jail?	1
5209174	What...	1
1786284	And the--	0
6332785	Well, could the respondent just publish this in a little newspaper format and claim a journalistic exception?	1
8571240	It does allow the imposition of these things for an employer suit that could be considered objectively reasonable at the time it was brought.	1
3934434	You were saying that parties can't confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court.	1

1136520	rates to a...	0
1893242	And let me ask you, is it often that roadblocks are set up just to get information like this?	1
139518	Or is there a time limit?	0
2344947	Now, you want us to apply a presumption that a petition is timely if it's filed within 60 days.	0
1770468	Is there some reason why we shouldn't do that here?	0
6693238	filed...	1
5563802	As long as something is clearly identifiable as a notice of appeal, what is it that says that errors in designating the, the details, are incurable?	1
6230058	No...	1
403467	And and why wasn't...	1
9350836	What is your...	1
9534490	Why shouldn't the federal court have decided these issues of immunity of the officers when it had the case before it?	1
4385629	But this isn't a question of State law.	1
3098247	As I read it, if your notice complies with all the conditions of Rule 4, it is valid.	1
50045	But it's... it can be a very complicated question to know what time is left to make a State claim.	0
3509167	You should actually be grateful for this--	1
1902049	Which would make it important to have a protest.	0
1454780	Correct, Your Honor.	0
907470	Well, that might affect the decision of whether they are seamen covered under the Jones Act.	0
2461971	Well, the big one is just...  it's too small to see.	1
3503821	that's a legitimate...	1
8902645	--but not willing to let the customs service do the same thing?	1
1954132	Yeah.	0
3519971	Mr. Miller... General Miller, you have four--	1
362011	as long as we have an adequate...	1
1674499	There would be no prejudgment interest.	1
3995935	And somebody comes along and knows the regulation is there but says, look, that regulation is going to have to be applied in a reasonable manner, I'm going to pay you X amount for this property and then challenge it.	1
384615	In other words, don't want to make them mad.	1
870908	Yes, but that's possible to do.	0
8860537	Do you say that the State laws that prohibit children from smoking are invalid somehow?	1
2378104	I couldn't understand.	0
3901850	A kind that people would buy for a single dose?	1
4848940	What's your response to that?	1
4259082	Just before you do, Mr. Sutton, I want to double-check on one assumption I'm making.	1
1680976	But it is odd, because your approach basically tells us, well, the APA just sets a minimum standard, and any other standard that's more, well, then that applies.	0
104297	That's what everybody is concerned about.	0
6375965	Don't you.	1
3990633	where the purpose of the action of the official is to conceal facts that would have provided the basis for a legal recovery in court.	1
336502	--The... the national--	1
1777247	Where?	1
7729604	Well, I... I suppose a lot of credit--	1
1614657	At the end of the...	1
1941593	If it can go to the court of appeals, but this is -- I mean, you have the question that it was based on a hunch, but you give the discretion to the magistrate who heard the evidence.	0
8668289	You know, if it required closing down the entire, the entire steel industry, for example.	1
3563978	Now, that happens not... that happens not to help the respondent here.	1
8672022	Right.	1
7082389	May I ask one very brief question?	1
7572332	for my suggestion...	1
260501	Telecommunications, we we don't have a position.	0
9191257	So at least under the system that we have had with political parties, the political parties are accountable and are transparent.	1
4099802	But never an assertion that the statements were involuntary.	1
6327613	And therefore, when you earlier made the argument that there is something very... something less than credible in the State's claim that it's merely trying to inform the public when, in fact, it makes no differentiation between current dangerousness and un-current dangerousness, the answer is there is... or an answer is... there is a very high recidivism rate, and that high recidivism rate does support the claim that there is something that... that it is credible to say that by publishing this information, we are simply trying to inform people of a probability of dangerousness, leaving them to do what they want.	1
3751408	You're telling me it's not property until you go into court?	1
8758016	is on the Government.	1
9345254	Does the word in... and does the word in any court mean in any Tribal Court in your view?	1
3701098	or adult motels.	1
558779	Exemption.	1
7861920	I thought that's what you were doing.	1
853412	What about a dog sniff, how about a dog sniff?	0
8012941	From a standpoint of public policy, why in the world would Congress want to exclude a broadly marketed scheme like this from the definition of investment contract?	1
236346	Well, isn't that an Establishment Clause issue?	0
9230482	Skidmore rather than Chevron?	1
5026023	Wait a second, I'd like to get both.	1
1289491	Yes, Your Honor...	1
6072423	area...	1
6281222	There are lots of these gambling boats that are parked--	1
5204409	you...	1
1129892	I suppose under your theory that's invalid, too.	0
8504274	It's settled in the Ninth Circuit?	1
8850789	Oh, if in i- in yes, if if there were a dispute between the two over any matter the employer certainly could.	1
9080871	Yes.	1
1490889	I'm interested in the Chief Justice's hypothetical.	1
4753022	And I would have thought that that would be sufficient rather than to raise an appropriate federal question, rather than to say there's no judicial review here in Florida.	1
6939704	Are any of the other provisions enforceable?	1
2302270	That part I understand.	1
1526967	No...	1
6394302	Mr. Feldman, you have 4 minutes remaining.	1
451391	I thought the advantage might be as described in the Florida case, Boardman v. Esteva, saying that the certified election returns which occur after the protest period are presumptively correct, and they must be upheld unless clearly outside legal requirements.	0
1499785	--Well, you... you're saying that if there's a circuit different, there's a denial of equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment?	1
2038290	For instance, the requirement that to sell cigarettes it has to be a person-to-person transaction.	1
6945311	certainly a broad range of...	1
579664	But if you have a reasonable analysis--	0
7393472	Now, this may not be...	1
7670259	Isn't it pretty darn specific in identifying courts by reference to a certain subject matter?	1
2883315	But under the statute we have here, you have affirmative steps that have to be taken for the rest of the person's life if he's a violent offender, to report four times a year.	1
9412629	Well, the public isn't buying it.	1
9347781	And that, I think, comes from the ABA professional rules, and I... and I believe it's Model Rule 1.1, which suggests that competence is imputed to attorneys that operate within the same firm, and that confirms that, at least for private firm purposes, two attorneys from the same firm would be considered to be the same attorney for procedural default... default purposes, and we think the same approach would follow with respect to Public Defender's Offices, so I don't think that the question of the same attorney is going to give rise to a great deal of litigation or uncertainty.	1
3357344	Mr. DuMont...	1
8936481	You're saying--	1
4456793	On your reading.	1
2104565	So, don't we have to look at what appropriate means in this context?	0
7246325	How do you get the boat to the landlocked lake?	1
2649782	Oh.	1
3752071	It has to do with evidence admitted at trial.	1
3416863	Well, is there any indication that the tribe would waive its immunity in its own court in this case?	1
1282524	Custody is a Fourth Amendment concept, and that would -- that type of a claim, that type of damage, would come under the Fourth Amendment umbrella under the constitutional division of labor that this Court set forth in Footnote 8 of Manuel.	0
2870567	If you're really interested in why the legislature did it, you ought to get affidavits from every legislator saying this is why I voted for it, and if 51 percent voted for it for a certain reason, that was the reason.	1
587791	What if--	0
1106589	Now, can the police just decide they're going to sniff any car that's parked on Capitol Hill?	0
2165087	Why do they want to pay the cost of having a mechanic disassemble an engine unless they have a good reason for doing it?	1
9516986	Mr. Sarnowski, did the State raise the 2253(c) problem, the applicability of AEDPA and the timeliness, the failure to file, get a certificate of appealability?	1
9610159	I gather is what you're --	1
779428	How far along is that process? When is that going to be adopted?	0
4495505	--what we suggested in Chickasaw Nation.	1
650998	Yes, you may, General Waxman.	1
2405914	Could you do it under any branch of California law?	1
494463	He's said he isn't going to.	0
8781091	Okay but that's, I mean, that may be a very good argument to Congress, maybe a dangerous argument because the soft money opponents may find something to run with there, but I'm not sure that it's an argument, and I realize you were asked to get into this, but I'm not sure that it's an argument that's going to help us decide this case.	1
2831043	There are three different kinds of funding programs going on?	1
1939968	How long was it in effect?	0
552357	What does that include?	0
1641794	Supposing...	1
749138	You have a number, and you have the maps.	1
4942171	Well, they could be adjudicated in State court, couldn't they?	1
3894544	The...	1
2281654	Yes.	0
1750265	Well, apparently that was done.	0
8256765	Did the Secretary consider alternatives?	1
6787156	right.	1
5337887	That doesn't tell you who is appealing.	1
2179391	Ms. O'Connor?	1
1895680	Justice Justice Scalia--	1
7478862	Where do I look to find if that's so or not?	1
8051616	What portion is wetland and what portion upland?	1
2763208	So is there... why isn't there then a question here as to whether this set of fill regulations is reasonable or unreasonable?	1
3137190	So Justice Ginsburg, in response to your question, the courts of appeals are faced with the same array of options whether this Court adopts a procedural default principle or not, and in the Ninth Circuit, for example, in 2001, the Court faced roughly on the order of 50 direct appeals in which ineffective assistance of counsel was asserted as a basis for relief, and in 10 of those cases, the Court was able to decide conclusively that the claim was lacking in merit and therefore couldn't be brought again under 2255, and--	1
323620	question here.	0
8843572	Is this a situation where the state has just turned its back and said, we don't care?	1

9178178	there isn't.	1
5079982	legislators have passed.	1
772042	It's only what, about 5, 6 percent?	1
3904766	--Well, except the Eighth Circuit didn't address that second question.	1
6547768	The question in my mind is, why make this so complicated?	1
959929	I can't see much difference.	0
102847	disability as an expectation-	1
1282590	"""If you find there any mitigating circumstances in this case. """	1
4679168	Do you think that would be okay?	1
5832085	Mr. Everett, the one thing that puzzles me about that argument is in this footnote 25 in your brief, when you try to answer the question, what swaps could be made, and you give a few examples, and in every example the result would be a more bizarre shape, not a more compact shape.	1
1138738	That was...	1
8106237	Honor s-	1
602690	I think -- I'm not sure there is one, and I think that this type of conduct is so stunning and so in contradiction of our basic fundamental policies that it stands alone --	0
1353707	forth, but...	0
2098507	Well, would that include... if a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include law clerk memos to the judge?	0
1632920	I couldn't understand.	0
1573683	case.	1
5282195	If the discrete situation applies in the accident, why shouldn't the discrete situation, in effect, rule apply here if they can show by the records kept by the dam that except in, let's say, five instances in which the canal was used for overflow for flood control purposes, all the other water that was diverted into that canal was for nonflood-control purposes and therefore you would get your immunity on some apportionment theory?	1
7906250	It wasn't just a rule for Federal courts, was it?	1
1715341	We di-	1
5795509	Suppose everything is the same, except that the organization is only for public schools, and only public schools compete in these competitions.	1
1061429	We're not up here arguing about the validity of the instructions.	0
3911630	Well, there's a big difference between being, say, in Seattle, Washington, and Ellis Island, never being able to get off the island.	1
4867044	Circuit...	1
6641956	Well, Mr. Ayer, if I just read the statutory language as it appears now, the impression I get is that the language in capital (A), little (ii), except that the liability, just applies to little (ii).	1
6590686	I think that's right, Justice Kennedy.	1
3466285	answer the question, though, and I have the same problem Justice Breyer does.	1
2418446	It can have a voucher program, but if it does, it has to fund all private and religious schools with a voucher program?	1

500430	The things below here are not so bad.	1
4984013	If it were different... if, for example... some counties around the country don't prosecute on cases like this, or maybe the quantity would have to be a little smaller.	1
8069469	Right?	1
639752	There's no objection.	1
829875	Would it protect him from a civil damages action as well as prosecution in a criminal case?	0
1342964	Should... should our doctrine take that into account, do you suppose?	0
3449138	Well, maybe... maybe it doesn't do that much.	1
1872425	Is it possible that the Congress and/or the State could treat Hawaiians as it treats Native Americans--	0

7216086	penalty. That's if...	1
2371829	What do you do in that case?	1
608042	Now just to be clear, Mr. Estrada, you take the position that ERISA Section 502(a) completely preempts the Texas scheme here?	0
6714453	--mixed question.	1
235536	We... don't we have to give any weight at all to the jury finding there or--	0
6434465	Have your...	1
6842826	The question that I asked before--	1
4228892	I would have thought that consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness; perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the issue of fairness.	1
2162835	I think there's another element that you're ignoring.	0
5132994	Is there any reason why we should address it, since it came so late in the day?	1
6682118	Now, if the very same clause were in a contract that your client entered into with a state, do you think that we would have found a waiver of Eleventh Amendment immunity?	1
5912429	been true.	1
7859617	Is there is there any...	1
4653147	[Laughter]	1
6688898	He's not raising any treaty.	1
2279596	You mentioned the multiple appellants, and that was the problem of one person filing a notice of appeal, putting down a lot of other names, and you didn't know whether the other names really wanted to appeal.	1
8653830	Would you?	1
3080219	This is far removed from that.	1
5389792	But you're trying to say that this expert was not really an expert.	1
1862813	Do we know how Colorado has interpreted that?	0
1136656	Most of...	1
2734325	things that you...	1
4436697	Probably not, but I just wonder about the kind of practice if the lawyer doesn't point it out to the court.	1
7173246	"""if you find there any mitigating circumstances in this case. """	1
9629543	Mr. Frederick, I don't mean to interrupt you, but I hope you'll tell us some time in the argument what you don't tell us in your brief, whether you defend the Ninth Circuit's test.	1
4286657	For instance, why does a claim that Dow negligently failed to field test its product on peanuts on acid soil impose a label requirement?	1
2189060	So for instance, a stop might reasonably take longer if there are more people in the car so that the officer has to check the the criminal histories of more people in the car.	0
1847526	That's why I think you have to get to the third part of this, which is the causation part, if we're going to say anything useful, and on that I thought you'd say, look across the year about 98 percent of the time it is diverted from the San Joaquin bed just for irrigation purposes.	1
4374628	But the main coach, even in the private school, would have to be a full-time employee?	1
2822867	Thank you.	1
8346012	substantial gainful activity.	1
1043675	Well, what would you call rule fifteen C of the Federal Rules of Civil...	1
4214303	Was it voted on in the House?	1
649779	--Well, the other -- the other things that are tasked in part of the traffic offense where there is no doubt -- and that could be questionable -- but there's no doubt that a dog sniff is not part of the offense.	0
4209451	On your theory, will there ever be a situation in which the immunity won't apply?	1
5893719	I thought that's what he was saying.	1
6568037	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.	1
732507	Mhm.	0
1431958	He seemed to be saying the Federal Government does make these determinations, and you seem to be saying they just make a blanket determination and we don't want them to make individual determinations.	0
206533	Right.	0
5444000	If it's...  if...	1
8283069	that...	1
7500784	In fact, it's rather common?	1
1208026	Why don't you focus on the statement and tell us why it would or would not be different?	1
1765675	Right.	1
2805492	So Congress did later have legislation that reserved gas that you think can persuasively be shown to include coalbed methane.	1
2299852	be some...	0
8919258	I sh- I sure do.	1
3034415	So did the Frazer case overrule some of this California doctrine on statute of limitations that you've just told us about?	1
9660533	Why wouldn't required embrace the common law as well as... I don't see any difference.	1
6747531	All right.	1
8550324	But I saw no force by the man on the left insofar as the van was concerned.	1
2782498	our...	1
2108298	They're...	0
4095585	in this case that involves that issue at all.	1
6704944	But is it a...  it is the type of scheme transaction in which people invest their money on...  for those types of purposes, and...  and in...  where...  where there are difficulties at the margin, this Court and the SEC have provided a formula by which these various different factors can be examined as in the Reves case.	1
1918425	And you take the position that if you just sell 18 percent of the merchandise is adult, then it doesn't qualify?	1
6783644	And it is a little curious that the State isn't willing to talk to the prisoner's counsel about considering one of the other ways of doing it.	1
9251325	But...  but, Mr. Olson, why can't a local agency or community decide it's going to buy vehicles and will buy no diesel vehicles?	1
4687542	In every State of the Union you can drain?	1
4885868	is. Well, what should...	1
5299395	In lieu of the current system of limitations on contributions to make.	1
7276292	It doesn't say it wasn't valid; it says specifically what you do.	1
1162776	he do -- What...	1
3435961	Well, what is the best indication that in those subsequent legislation, in the subsequent legislation reserving gas to the Government, that it intended the gas to include the coalbed methane?	1
43426	--that's at issue?	1
2756768	But then what do you do?	1
918369	And I was explaining the reasons that an officer might want to give a ticket contemporaneously with or before doing a dog sniff.	0
794483	But if there is no attempt to weed out the dangerous from the non-dangerous, then the claim that the object is simply to apprise the public of who is dangerous is not so credible.	1
6498849	--General Under--	1

1050280	But on your theory of strict scrutiny of Federal restrictions, on what basis could the ban on television and radio survive, other than the embrace of the tobacco people, who say, well, we'll put up with it?	1
774675	--Do I understand you?	1
1175265	--I think that's right, but as other members of the Court have suggested, once there's probable cause to stop someone for--	0
1783474	I think it might be a vessel, but probably not in navigation while it's tied up or in mothballs.	0
7267973	[Laughter]	1
185777	equipment...	0
7113830	Well, now, the parties presumably could agree among themselves in the contract what law to apply.	1
8679600	And sometimes if the safety risk is minimal but the effectiveness is great, I understood at least, that could affect the decisions.	1
1793858	The honorable court is now adjourned until Monday next at ten o'clock.	1
2102207	Well, this isn't a very sympathetic case with somebody who's been abusing his stepdaughter.	0
3868974	Do you agree with--	1
2272264	Supposing...	1
6514131	--Not even a name?	1
933228	No.	0
5792480	I just... I have yet to hear a reason.	1
6332297	Well, if... now that the Eleventh Amendment immunity issue is gone, don't we have to deal with City of Newport?	1
1433293	area...	1
235546	He was denied admission, I think, in 1997?	0
4598569	I think that is one difficulty with your position.	1
233616	I'm not -- I'm not going to dispute that with you, Judge Ginsburg.	0
1635984	But I don't understand that.	1
7559015	"""even though you answer yes to one, two and three you also have a responsibility to consider mitigating evidence and if you do so, you may in fact answer this fourth question. """	1
8760239	It didn't come from the statute that governs post judgment interest for district courts.	1
9220984	We have other authorities saying that no child is required to say the pledge.	1
283136	the legislatures...	1
9203440	[Laughter]	1
6607464	[Laughter]	1
640915	--was bashed in?	0
440321	What's the closest analogy, do you suppose?	0
1519718	Well, General Waxman, certainly in theory a State could provide adequate remedies for violation and could, indeed, apply correctly Federal patent law in doing so, could they not?	1
7571256	Well, this Court has already held...	1
7023020	Because?	1
8117619	It is not property.	1
3597800	All right, then on your theory... and what you've just said raises the same question that your answer to Justice Breyer raised with me.	1
8138856	From you.	1
5577130	Well, is that not adequate post-deprivation relief, even if you assume there's some State action and some problem?	1
2188673	so forth. Those...	1
8929867	And you think...	1
8698911	What... what if the State simply decided we're going to put on the Internet, the same way that Alaska does here, the names of all the people who had criminal convictions of any sort without any more information in... in the last 5 years?	1
4018307	Well, yeah.	1
1931209	I suppose that would be your argument.	0
598617	You were saying that the only advertising, then, that could be targeted under a properly tailored scheme is an ad which literally had a juvenile, literal juvenile appeal, you know, smart kids smoke, Wind in the Willows characters with cigarettes?	1
5898616	in in resp-	1
1467142	Which she doesn't have to say.	1
1168451	That's the problem.	0
4577127	The... am I wrong about that?	1
6169717	Even without exigent circumstances you think that he could have made the exclusion from the house?	1
83106	Thank you, Justice Ginsburg.	0
7599521	upon...	1
2443788	Right.	1
6909617	It was a procedural...	1
5434411	Congress did change this because it wanted to make it simple for people.	1
196634	Well, isn't that an Establishment Clause issue?	0
6550190	There's...	1
1757432	Your Honor, I would be happy to explain, to explain to you what's wrong with Section 323(b) if that is what I understand your question to be.	1
1717371	It's been litigated under the Establishment Clause, right?	0
444006	And I have to say even as a threshold matter, I don't know why that implies an economic criterion in some different way than a reference to or a different degree than a reference to individual health would do.	1
7472108	Why wouldn't that be a sensible way for us to... to go, leaving the State courts to run their systems any way they want to?	1
5576024	There's... on occasion... I... it seems to me that case... opinion perhaps represents a decision that a particular claim is logically antecedent to another one, and it seems to me you have a hard time saying that here.	1
3485116	doesn't it?	1
6882073	But there would be...	1
1779063	So I think that's a different case.	1
645317	Let me ask you one other...	1
9412861	Did they refer to the special issues in their comment on the instructions?	1
1926569	Yes, all right.	0
5332091	Are you saying that there's...  is there a right of an individual to go their own way even though there's a police officer known to be on the scene?	1
9052482	factors.	1
5117576	definition...	1
8492438	[Laughter]	1
4837807	We have one set of standards for when an Indian tribe is deemed to have waived its sovereign immunity and another for the state and, why should we do that?	1
786916	They say the bulk of the gambling is in private casinos, so we're hitting the bulk of the problem by this ban.	0
1076832	That is, that there is not the same high recidivism rate for crimes generally that there is, apparently undisputedly, for sex crimes in the State of Alaska.	1
4078121	I thought that was what we were looking at.	1
2297705	So whatever you're proposing, you think the CADC correctly employed in that case?	0
5083331	I know.	1
3737936	Its inevitable effect would be to complicate and expose to collateral attack confessions of guilt which approximat- which account for approximately ninety-five percent of all convictions in the Federal system and to stifle the market for plea bargains, which this Court has described as an essential component of the administration of justice.	1
5633112	General Underwood, what is your paraphrase of what this statute means, no requirement or prohibition... you don't want to say, based on smoking and health.	1
8437876	I would have thought it was--	1
3074628	And Darden says, well, we're going to look to the common law, so what makes you think we'd do something else in this situation?	1
944208	It's not more than that, which it isn't anywhere near that, but still, let's assume that.	1
769860	And what do we do if we think the Ninth Circuit was off base in... in whether Mena could be questioned about her immigration status?	1
678685	You don't think it even mean Tribal Court, do you?	1
2044487	Should we just look to that case and analyzing this rather than the... some zoning cases and other things?	1
8460698	And doesn't it go beyond merely an agreement to be subject to a court with jurisdiction or with competent jurisdiction?	1
7689405	Well, if Congress never decided it, then you're saying that the 1909 things didn't... don't speak one way or the other to it?	1
413790	I think that does create arbitrary results from the perspective of the intrusion on the individual.	0
2377366	See, I don't understand that at all.	1
8822170	Congress, first of all, decided to make the definition as wide as possible to use again this Court's language to cover everything that might commonly be understood to be a security, and because promoters are so ingenious, to cover all types of investments that might carry some of those characteristics.	1
1724599	Thank you, Ms. Millett.	1
7870884	--Yes.	1
7806284	Just in just as a general proposition.	1
219092	Blatt, we'll hear from you.	1
5078865	I'd als-	1
8767622	[Laughter]	1
34808	--in making the decision.	0
6297894	With all due respect --	1
6312983	--You say the control is by governmental institution, and the principal of the school goes to this... sits on this board, or belongs to the... by reason of the fact he's a principal.	1
2137355	Yes.	1

5919800	Do milk prices tend to rise and fall over a wide region of the United States at the same time, or does it tend to be very spotty?	1
2361774	And -- and I -- I think we --	0
3144620	Then come back and tell me, tell me why transient coughing effects are... shouldn't be considered.	1
1886075	No.	0
707684	Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.	1
1402328	How about software for particular subjects where you can examine the content of it and don't give it to the school, just maintain the ownership in the public agency, but allow it to be used, or a map?	1
5259918	What's... what's the consensual relationship of the hotel guests with the tribe?	1
3076674	Is that enough?	1
8638847	We're just saying we can't touch the political process unless you get yourself into a suspect class.	1
717317	It isn't clear to me.	1
5639743	I see that, but... okay.	1
3780748	That's the argument.	1
2729232	Based...	1
1100781	That's...	1
3439230	No, okay.	1
958470	[Laughter]	1
4019865	For ozone.	1
669248	You see some statements that it's de novo review.	0
923107	Well, do we decide this case on the understanding that it was lawful to make the recording?	1
1149876	--Okay.	1
2342756	Well, in this case, has the court below directly ruled on whether there's a 107 cause of action here?	1
9426613	--Exactly, Your Honor.	1
5646665	The...	1
7998333	But this...	1
476281	--the O'Brien test?	0
9396844	They can.	1
8988526	[Laughter]	1
2962410	substantial references.	1
6194499	Number tw--	1
370924	I mean, some of them have the disclaimer right on the page saying we're not labeling this person dangerous and... and have a chance for a person to get off it.	1
7228688	That's third from the bottom, basically, from a health point of view.	1
9469235	I mean I don't know... I'm not sure you get into harmless error.	1
4394652	--advert to that?	1
4422559	Yes, but this is in some ways a sort of derivative cause of action that Trinko brings with...  with the primary injured party probably being AT&T.	1
2020903	Your Honor, under the prior regime, the Republican National Committee had 12 separate accounts that it ran that were in compliance with the various permutations of state law, so that when it wanted to participate in Connecticut, for example, it had Connecticut-compliant money to do so.	1
781495	regulation.	0
1101869	They just go into the pool in time.	0
5176480	But this... this scheme does something else, it seems to me.	1
8585080	Because?	1
5426172	And must... must the petitioner seeking habeas relief also fairly present the factual basis for the claim?	1
6289773	Well, there's certainly no ex post facto problem there, is there?	1
1411615	--and another to engage in a separate study as a precursor to the off-road vehicle thing.	0
5775040	Your Honor...	1
177414	--Right.	0
8270362	In the State of Tennessee?	1
6759483	Now, if your focus is on the Friant Dam and you look at the overall project in a third of the State of California, you can say it's related to flood control, but if you focus instead in the Madera Canal, the Ninth Circuit said it just wasn't... it serves no flood control purpose.	1
824602	General Underwood, what is your paraphrase of what this statute means, no requirement or prohibition... you don't want to say, based on smoking and health.	1
3867685	And it was done by the court.	1
2879629	I mean, would you like to... Article II?	1
6804272	No comment might not be a lie, Justice Stevens, but but at but this the the respondent specifically says it would have been constitutional to say I cannot get back to you, or if there is information, we're not in a position to give it to you.	1
365144	I mean, there... it... it's a means, it seems to me, of expanding copyright protection.	0
77613	Yes, and if it doesn't... doesn't--	1
4803129	Is everything that is bad regulation punishment?	1
932672	That there's nothing in the record to show that.	0
1336746	So you like what they did, the permission to have the slot machines, but then say, ah, but once... they have to give us as sweet a deal as they gave the riverboats.	1
1205826	But it's not recognized in the Federal statute or in the regulations.	0
3880597	In fact, the court should grant relief on ineffectiveness grounds on direct appeal only in situations such as the one that confronted the Court in Kimmelman, where there was an extended dialogue between trial counsel and the trial court concerning trial counsel's assertively deficient decision--	1
4619866	I mean, the... but the... my thought was, and this might be totally wrong, that it isn't that the... you know, the fact that something was done in the Middle Ages is not, whoever Holmes said, a reason for following it, so let's start with the Restatement rule.	1
3203335	Here, because there's no give, it does have a punitive feel.	1
2747303	In this case--	1
67207	I read your brief.	1
8451187	So it--	1
9359149	thirty-one twenty-one A. Thirty-one...	1
928612	I thought that the law itself said that this is the only remedy that the remedy of the prime or its assignee suing was the only remedy, was the exclusive remedy.	1
2093649	And when you put all those together, where do you go?	1
1990399	--If you want to talk about violence to the statute, Nierotko, it seems to me, does a fair amount of violence to the statute, and I suppose the question is whether you're going to... whether it's worse to extend that violence to both half of... both halves of the statute, or to leave Nierotko where it is as a case that, where a hard case made bad law, taking the word paid not to mean paid in order to prevent Social Security recipients from being read out of the system.	1
1133303	Yes.	1
5375694	by these conditions.	1
758281	ahead.	1
942648	Right. It's got to be a...	0
3542390	Abolutely.	1
8157232	The Freedman case seemed to require prompt judicial determination, didn't it?	1
1548474	State law.	1
7223409	General Underwood, in the few minutes remaining, do you think you could give us a 1-minute explanation of your views about the First Amendment issues?	1
3603815	But it's not the kind...	1
2737263	The students get some credit for physical education, toward that requirement, from being on this varsity team?	1
8003259	I mean, that could be done, couldn't it?	1
2319718	I don't discount that, yes.	0
8341636	I... I don't know.	1
1399606	There, the vast majority of the courts of appeals have said that you can extend a traffic stop for unrelated questioning, and the courts have looked to how much time does the questioning take, how long is the overall stop, and was the officer reasonably diligent with respect to the traffic mission.	0
2452278	It's at page fifty-eight A.	1
925138	outside world?	1
8292248	The test is circular.	1
2256983	competent to assist his lawyers. There's a difference there.	1
9170974	but Congress...	1
1061491	Now, did the Fourth Circuit rest on some grounds of mootness as opposed to standing?	0
5184331	You mean, unaware in fact, even if the plaintiff should have been aware?	1
6446544	Well, does it make a difference?	1
1634389	[Laughter]	1
7487307	--That's controverted.	1
5827774	[Laughter]	1
5114527	It says that... Nierotko is about back pay being covered by the Social Security Act and, more importantly, the Court says that even though the administrators think it shouldn't fall within it--	1
4023011	Well, I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that many of those instruments that are ordinary debt instruments may be investment contracts as well.	1
310817	What it accomplishes is the -- is the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.	0
8107450	system.	1
388517	evidence...	1
1165931	The trial judge denied it because he wanted to go to the hospital with his daughter on one day and he had another trial in another case starting the day after.	1
7302496	That's correct.	1
2643300	That's not in the record, is it?	1
1472144	And you are basing that on practice of lawyers at the time or something?	0
7165851	Congress did change this because it wanted to make it simple for people.	1
2232987	so what should I do as a juror if I thought that a life sentence is appropriate because of the abused childhood and the mental retardation, but I didn't think a life sentence as reflected by a negative answer to these questions was appropriate, what am I supposed to do?	1
530702	[Laughter]	1
1801685	Why is this any different?	1
9091584	--there are... are there not instances in the record in which individuals who have contributed their maximum directly to the candidate have then made contributions to the political party?	1
4174128	can assume that if...	1
1163010	percentage...	1
3791656	Now you're complaining about that, so if he doesn't have discretion, then why isn't my horrendous imaginary hypothetical a real problem?	1
5630593	crashes...	1
5075513	When you--	1
264758	No.	1
6812830	Assuming the Government never intervenes, as it has a right to do in one of these actions, would it be res judicata on the Government afterwards?	1
3066880	The jury is told and instructed, don't consider the sentence.	1
9629373	offered.	1
5326300	[Laughter]	1
1641714	Well, Your Honor, there's an obligation under only two circumstances.	0
9415533	tips on there.	1
3118723	But are you saying right from the very reading of this law, it is necessarily punitive?	1
3573808	Well but y- i-	1
5201018	or do they have to...	1
261549	Even though in conducting the hotel it isn't dealing with members of the tribe?	0
1496036	That just came out of no place.	0
6703271	loss of visiting privileges? That could be crucial to a prisoner.	1
5622155	Footnote 26 or something?	1
5159551	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock.	1
7309444	Do you think that's a permissible political activity for the legislature to get involved in?	1
5335092	We've never held that squarely, have we?	1
3285795	Is that an issue before us?	1
2916839	That wasn't the hotel operation in Ashcroft, was it?	1
4798246	But you...	1
620470	And the Court denied it.	0
7783888	You don't--	1
7985133	[Inaudible]	1
9356717	--There was no Federal Tort Claims Act.	1
2187	You do have OSHA standards.	0
2019995	Now, after the trial court resolved it and denied relief, then there's no review mechanism other than filing an original writ with the court of appeals?	0
4565596	Well, I don't know.	1
761403	Well, have we looked to whether the statement was deliberately elicited?	0
6894996	multiple...	1
992325	Is the one 3328.3, the one defining waters of the United States?	0
2780772	--in other words, the concept of back pay is different here than if the employer is just late?	1
3121379	so on and so...	1
743401	whim,	1
2269510	The things below here are not so bad.	1
3752032	indictment.	1
7296782	It just shows that it's stupid.	1
97997	General Olson, we'll hear from you.	1
6178678	And all of a sudden they're telling us that that's more stringent than a substantial evidence standard.	1
677715	--if we agreed with you here on the blanket primary thing, wouldn't we be casting some doubt on the open primary system as well?	1
1323806	Under what section of the labor code?	1
7177345	Or is it later?	1
2269132	You say the gas even in the lump of coal that's on the cart is technically yours, although there's nothing you can do about it, but you say that's yours, too.	1
1876309	--Well then you really don't defend the Ninth Circuit's decision.	1
1190072	Well, but I mean, I--	1
1998530	From your perspective.	0
8850003	Defendant and his counsel say okay.	1
1124195	Yes.	1
7078957	So what are we arguing about, the legs?	1
2898042	what if we think there's a real problem with that notion under this scheme, where the whole object was to have it administratively determined and it was a funding mechanism, and under the act, the penalty for not following it is a cut-off of funding.	1
1803385	Did they exist in 1985?	1
6937320	A month.	1
6857471	--before they're disrupted by a Federal judgment.	1
2136823	I thought they were all in the same boat.	0
2983818	The tort of...	1
5446960	That's what juries...	1
8951653	--In any case you didn't get that alternative instruction so we don't get into Roberts, right?	1
957179	Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:	0
1489087	Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of action, is it?	0
3320135	That is... I mean, I read your brief.	1
3899096	at this point...	1
276728	And their principal complaint, as I understand it, is that this is punishment because we can't get out.	1
4794277	Probably not, but I just wonder about the kind of practice if the lawyer doesn't point it out to the court.	1
3013068	The honorable court is now adjourned until tomorrow at 10 o'clock.	1
91993	Do we start with a presumption that the legislature acted in good faith and for proper motives in drawing these plans?	1
8104686	proceedings...	1
9230352	rules required.	1
3403318	Which is true in any situation in which there's a prime and a sub, so what is different about the fact that the prime in this case has contracted with the State?	1
4682778	In... in the Federal court you think they're routinely appointed by the state?	1
4279102	Well, you didn't even cite Darden, I don't think.	1
4186272	That's going back...	1
2318873	On content neutrality, the ordinance at issue in Barnes, as I recall, prohibited public nudity in general.	0
2054089	Well, Congress did want patent law to be uniform, didn't it?	0
547383	Would you enlighten us on just how this transaction gets authorized in the ordinary course of events and in this event?	0
9028110	The... the offense has resulted in a conviction and a penalty.	1
2722840	close to...	1
1109673	During the time of...	1
1453054	That, in fact, involved pretrial deprivations -- deprivations of right up to the time of trial.	0
4906396	Well, I'm trying to find out what indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys attempting to represent here.	1
5255717	The investor doesn't care whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return.	1
749505	Well, can we take the case on the assumption that there's a substantial risk that in this context he would have destroyed the evidence?	1
1751077	who, in the end, have to change their conduct.	1

2289409	What it accomplishes is the -- is the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.	0
1334875	Tell us how we know exactly how much discretion the State of Colorado wanted to give to the police.	0
8277452	Why does he have to show why he wanted to do the fill? I mean the only change was the fill, he said I've got a swampland in front of me, I'd rather be able to walk on it.	1
1024400	Am I wrong?	1
4733082	to access.	1
7525590	--Don't you think that's the more natural--	1
982290	Justice Ginsburg, there... there are decisions that address that issue in the State courts, and I believe at least a couple that address that issue in the Federal courts, and generally, the approach has been that defenders from the same Public... attorneys from the same Public Defender's Office are considered the same attorney for purposes of conflict, determining whether there's a conflict in one alleging that the other rendered ineffective assistance.	1
1473070	And they didn't do that?	1
8943099	Never?	1
1546465	I don't think that's necessary, no, because if -- if it is a self-standing claim that is indifferent to probable cause or favorable termination or any termination, then the presumption is that the standard accrual rule would apply. But, as I --	0
3565903	But that can't be the whole rule.	1
1868761	Mr. Phillips, I'm glad you're doing that.	0
4539107	Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law?	1
801740	In 323(e)(1)(B), there is a specific allowance for Federal officeholders to raise non-Federal money up to the analogous Federal limit for state and local candidates.	1
747985	Mr. Haberbush, would you be able, after the argument, to furnish the Court with the places in the record available to us where it shows that you raised the State statute of limitations issue below?	0
8030141	and suggest that that's...	1
9504347	Why don't you start with what the statute requires?	1
4925983	--Well, let counsel answer.	1
5614194	I don't know what I'm supposed to say about that.	1
4421115	Well, all we're talking about here is a transitional rule anyway.	1
1580758	Well, do you think that because of the holding in Buckley that it's no longer incumbent upon the State to establish the interest that the State has to support this?	0
5657887	Assume a represented party who has a lawyer... a paper is filed which purports to be a notice of appeal on behalf of that person and not signed by anybody.	1
2936998	You talked about Montana.	1
1401634	[Laughter]	1
5263619	That...	1
3711393	"--Oh, I thought you said ""waive""."	1
3740308	I thought in your brief the focus was an argument to the effect that the statute is satisfied so long as the licensee gets some kind of money or property.	1
5034033	As I understand...	1
5298212	I don't have the exact --	1
1200584	Mr. Goldstein, may I inquire of you whether other countries, for instance, in the EU area, have applied their own disability laws to some of the cruise ships that touch base in their courts?	0
8548927	Or what about quarantine of someone who has a communicable disease?	1
1895610	Because I would think your position might lead to the conclusion that that doesn't even set out the elements of a complete offense.	1
1560904	Well, if the statute, 406(b) reads as though when there is a judgment favorable to the claimant, the court may allow a reasonable fee.	0
1368161	It sure is.	0
3687814	They... they, in fact, were there and subpoenas had issued.	1
4534795	Yeah, but I suppose reasonable people could look at the pledge as not constituting a prayer.	1
4558864	Federal right.	1
1479150	Can I ask a clarifying question?	1
3698841	supervision. And...	1
3852019	not the nothing is threatened or carried out in the Federal program to deprive the nonconsenting prisoner of any privilege,	1
2024241	Do you think they couldn't get into federal court?	1
3859766	And if we go to.08, we get.6 of 1 percent and if we go to.07, we get.3 of 1 percent.	1
1225492	Right?	0
2698732	You haven't been around that long.	1
7809911	--He found deliberate eliciting of the comments at the first statement?	1
5497111	Once you take all costs and these other things out of it, why are you protecting the.6 and not the.3?	1
3254474	I mean  would not execute rocket scientists.	1
5759580	bargaining...	1
5297369	What is it about an admiralty case that makes prejudgment interest proper, and not in a common law case.	1
9558502	I wanted to get your response if there's a chance.	1
5458010	[Laughter]	1
3552009	Well, now now you've made...	1
4244508	Okay.	1
130536	And that's what we took the case to decide.	1
1716589	Now, we don't want to be nitpicking about this, but an ex post facto claim is a question of whether this is punishment, and they're saying it's not seen as punishment.	1
3527097	The Court remains in session.	1
1073722	Do your best.	1
5376474	Like like a...	1
3643197	If that has happened, then exactly what Justice Breyer is describing can occur, but it occurs in comparatively piddling amounts as against what would be possible if you win this case.	1
6446774	But I'm asking you.	1
2385961	when it comes...	1
6468324	Typically, yes, that's the way 2255 works, Mr. Chief Justice.	1
5932233	But they... the Megan's Laws are not all one size and shape.	1
2864076	and...	1
1746096	so I agree with you.	1
868739	You say, if I understand your case, you wouldn't take a position that flood waters are never... you're not going to try to prove that flood waters were never released through this canal, but you would say categorically that the canal itself, when constructed, had no flood control purpose.	1
2878769	so that's...	1
8001959	So back the prisoner comes with, yes, some that are exhausted now, but adding on some new, unexhausted claims.	1
6886684	[Inaudible]	1
2086855	We would normally think that, wouldn't we?	0
4908307	Well, maybe, maybe not.	1
1370697	There would be a duty to advise...	0
6910183	What is your example?	1
6056978	Why would the prime contractor have a defense to your lawsuit merely because the prime contractor has lost his defense to the Government's withholding?	1
1253930	Yes.	0
1303340	And the agency could say, and we have a different rule if you're not represented.	1
2463207	No, Your Honor.	1
1742077	Okay.	0
2385344	--Well, Petitioner's rule would say that the hypothetical I proposed is impermissible in every circumstance; that even a 30-second extension of a short traffic stop is always unreasonable even if that stop falls within the amount of time it usually takes to do routine traffic stops--	0
2157015	I think that's an unusual proposition.	1
699806	Well, one of the things that is somewhat troublesome about some of the briefs in front of you from the other side is that the other side is looking at this as though it were a penalty.	0
2407932	In the State of Tennessee?	1
4580168	Well, what do we make of information such as that provided by the State of Pennsylvania, talking about the application of the permit system to interbasin transfers in that State and saying how beneficial it has been?	1
2193808	Well, the dog sniff itself, I think, is a matter of seconds.	0
571089	I think that is one difficulty with your position.	1
5754148	And under that action, presumably this respondent would be affected by the outcome of that?	1
658174	Well, why not do the simplest thing?	1
576829	Suppose I believe a life sentence is appropriate but I don't believe a life sentence as reflected by a negative answer to a finding to the issue under consideration; I don't believe it is appropriate as reflected by deliberation; I don't believe it is appropriate as reflected by lack of dangerousness.	1
1250010	[Laughter]	1
1215064	That's the only rule that avoids arbitrary results.	0
9222563	Well, that's not true.	1
174359	And it's hard to know from your argument the answer to that.	0
566493	in the FCC?	0
7754201	She said...	1
2272862	Why isn't that a pure access issue?	0
5590539	And have we applied a more circumscribed review over the means of effectuating those policies?	1
8438886	In the Village of Stratton --	1
2268486	It--	0
5625674	Was that ever--	1

325160	it's that...	1

7229858	I I I really...	1
5724628	of day-to-day management.	1
1673569	Right, and...	1
290751	We don't normally address issues raised by amici, do we?	0
5867232	He pays it in January instead of December.	1
1295894	Is that in fact how it was done?	0
9243601	in in...	1
6336309	get to work a job that is even equivalent to that.	1
806919	I mean, that... that's just manufacturing something.	0
8605573	And for income tax purposes of the employees, it would be... we're talking back pay.	1
6014970	Thank you.	1
1857543	You do?	0
4205148	And... but the fact that the principals are joined in the organization by private school principals too makes no difference?	1
6807867	Indeed, I I I may be making the argument...	1
201375	The Roebuck facility has been closed now, as I understand it, and the incinerator removed.	1
2993155	What is the difference?	1
1115621	Actually, n- not all of that is true is Justice Kennedy.	0
5353276	--Yes.	1
710061	Even though in conducting the hotel it isn't dealing with members of the tribe?	0
781626	Are you relying on the Pend Orielle case?	0
8021031	But you just told me that you would not allow any written communication, even though a law clerk assignment had been made.	1
4354020	serve...	1
71753	I suppose that would be your argument.	0
1286460	There is one exception...	1
4009920	What is clear here?	1
8093354	I know we have an agreement on that.	1
9166819	It sounds like coordination to me.	1
3222004	Is it past defendants?	1
4467719	Right?	1
9079524	What other control does the school he comes from exercise over him?	1
1166943	ability to order...	0
3889348	There are no dams on the Mississippi River, needless to say.	1
7821521	So that's it for ozone.	1
9386279	And now it physically occupies 4 of the 35.	1
798309	If I understand, evidence that the money being used to fund purely state and local election activities?	0
847359	I guess my question is, is it rational speculation when you know it's not true?	1
7600139	Oh, so you... well then, you... what, you got your money back?	1
2779093	Apparently, to a nonuser of the canal, but flooding the property.	1
7001802	When you say $100, to reconnect it, it's about $100?	1
550432	Does that mean that every application of that statute that might subsequently be challenged would have to come up with the same answer?	1
2169100	Mr. Feldman--	1
1414031	Not 1338?	0
5489451	I...	1
2329284	It's not a search.	0
8203937	Yes, but didn't we... no, please.	1
4313843	Let the public make... you know, the later... later determination.	1
2321155	But that would be a very different question--	0
2757615	You think the answer to that is no, and I can't think of one.	1
219025	Yes, Your Honor, and and I think with...	1
720000	I mean, that's what it suggests anyway.	0
426303	What do we do generally, if you look at our precedents, on mixed questions of fact and law on appellate review?	0
2626753	Gee, I didn't think--	1
29168	No.	1
1174350	It didn't just enter a stay order, as would typically be the case.	0
4683046	It said, you can't, under... consistent with due process, hold back this money, isn't that right?	1
3880749	Well, Mr. Roberts, do they in Alaska have to go personally or not?	1
1592094	They didn't say that you shall revise the ozone standard every 5 years, did they?	1
8438543	It restricts sending even Federal money, noncorrupting Federal money down to the states.	1
5308702	Because this is the fear that some of them might be.	1
3813160	It's hard to say the homeowner had abandoned this heat information.	1
2661155	is met, as has already been pointed out, by the opportunity to put up a no trespassing, no solicitor sign.	1
209934	the effects on crime.	1
1798884	Did they do it for no reason at all?	1
385022	And I read this whole thing as a clear indication by Congress that it wanted to do exactly what the State was arguing ought to be done.	0
2075869	do anything about it.	1
521730	Why should we rule on that?	1
3928118	Now, is it reasonable to expect that a police officer could come on board and open the luggage compartment and then squeeze?	1
7213690	there was a section in nineteen ninety-eight passed by Congress, section thirty-four fourteen of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act providing that im- IRS would not threaten a taxpayer audit to coerce the taxpayer into entering a tip-reporting alternative commitment agreement, so at least Congress acknowledged...	1
2053890	I think the Florida court has sort of ignored that old Boardman case.	0
1462522	That's not a punitive intent.	1
5513556	the...	1
2285636	Mr. Phillips, may I ask, this is a case with some complex provisions, and is it the case that under the lease the Government had the power at least to suspend the lease?	0
623926	In order to avoid the arbitrary results that Petitioner's brightline rule would -- would impose on traffic stops, a dog sniff conducted during a traffic stop should be subject to a reasonableness analysis.	0
4269326	argument, Justice O'Connor. Yes. The statutory language definitely does require...	1
1505346	[Laughter]	1
6634437	behavior.	1
2649157	Well, that's right.	1
1104667	Assuming it does--	1
7356626	because they wouldn't have to -- The only problem...	1
3482179	What... what have we ever held was... was irrational that didn't involve race or... or, you know, political discrimination or something like that?	1
6624705	reasonable.	1
649881	They're taxed differently.	1
4951640	Thank you.	1
3617093	Justice Ginsburg, that's correct, but I think it's important to point out that that question, that situation is going to arise regardless of how this Court resolves the procedural default question, because in all the courts of appeals a defendant can raise an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.	1
3387453	No,	1
5747546	there...	1
1094240	One...	1
8204990	I thought that it was... when Colorado, or perhaps Kansas, knew that Kansas water was being depleted, and when you were able to prove in court how much, wasn't there something in the record that until there was computer modeling you couldn't estimate with any degree of accuracy--	1
5945313	So why would you complain about 3 o'clock?	1
1889023	If you... if you--	1
6662321	it was through his disability...	1
4740629	--assume, for a moment, that we didn't; could we, nonetheless, address the active inducement--	1
1031451	--So then, if I thought my question was important, then the answer would be... and I'm not saying it is, but if I came to that conclusion, I would then have to think, we should send it back to get this fact developed.	1
3654535	Well, that's not what this judge did.	1
5016197	searched.	1
3702698	--Okay.	1
6732971	Well, just on this point--	1
1374124	And this does an end run around that approach.	0
4131503	Affidavits from legislators?	1
2019770	do you propose some per se rule, as Mr. Devine was arguing, or are you advising us to stick with the Terry reasonable suspicion/ totality of the circumstances?	1
1837378	Very well, Mr. Sutton.	1
536744	Yes, Your Honor.	0
1875727	Now, what's the arbitrator to do with a provision like that?	0
1292717	Was that instruction one to which Merck preserved an objection?	0
6428964	Mr. Gornstein, we'll hear from you.	1
1910423	But you do not take that view.	0
3982562	Well, the petitioner says they didn't even need to get tribal court permission to get a search warrant.	1
4465933	determination.	1
1646659	Now, normally we would just defer to that, wouldn't we, and move on to the merits.	0
1831058	not?	1
4307074	actually occurred.	1
4002525	participates.	1
682004	That is correct.	1
3947678	I--	1
1836462	All right, so if you assume a Senate race that costs $4 million, let's say, the difference would be between whether you had to find 50 willing donors with families or a thousand.	1
532151	them.	1
8919099	We in effect... we did not say in Hohn that the COA request was itself a separate case, as... and Justice Scalia suggested a moment ago, we didn't say it was something new, and in fact elsewhere we spoke of the, in essence the indivisibility of the merits of the case from the COA, so if we read Hohn not as indicating that a COA is a new and separate proceeding, why do we have to be as complicated as you would have us be?	1
482393	that it...	0
4798430	No, Your Honor, I don't...	1
3900185	for their...	1
130266	people...	1
4860066	All of them.	1
5736535	The old text said, no statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes.	1
275395	So you say there can be solitary confinement for life, if that's what the State wants?	1
1298462	But it's so remarkable, isn't it, that the court did not notify the State and... and the defendant about what it was considering?	0
8575219	Justice...	1
16608	--But since the Court said in Caballas that a dog sniff is permissible to perform at stops sometimes, we think that the analysis as to when it is permissible--	0
3338871	along with the addition of H...	1
4946238	I mean, you... you didn't... the court below didn't think that privacy was limited to this... to the deceased?	1
8870061	Now, that's where I... it says you can't have a regulation based on smoking and health and I'm beginning, naively, to think, if this isn't based on smoking and health, what is, and so therefore, however I might feel about it, that's what the language says.	1
374455	Well, don't take your time to look it up.	0
1576689	--Well, the ADA itself makes an exception for things that aren't readily achievable.	0
404530	But in a in a situation where the employer's policy is just to create open positions every quarter, that aren't enforceable anyway on behalf of any employee, is it unreasonable to say the employer has to accommodate this disabled worker?	0
538336	[Laughter]	1
6820061	Your Honor, if the only word in 323(a) were receive, you would be right.	1
2423302	This specific question has not previously been decided by this Court, but the Court has never decided, and the cases that the Court referred to in Howey did not ever say that...  that the fixed return instrument was excluded from the term investment contract.	1
696622	Let the judge do it?	1
292196	Now, the dog, Your Honor, is different.	0
4009919	You know, but it's the... but the question is what does unequivocal mean here?	1
7825416	Now I would have thought that was the standard that we would be talking about.	1
6787914	And there's a waiting list.	1
3248721	defense. In...	1
1635419	It's a -- it's a question about the objective reasonableness of the length of the stop.	0
7298542	--Well, if that were the case, then all cigarette advertising would simply have brand names, or the photographs of the cigarette packages, and it would not have people in cowboy suits or people in bars or people in beaches doing sophisticated and healthy things, and that's just not the way the advertising is--	1
2919957	We haven't stated a number seven, 18, 32 we don't know either.	1
6526401	Would it breach... would it breach the trust that has been established to extend the vote to--	1
2179897	Okay.	0
1678373	counsel...	1
3311136	but it has done no such...	1
3064171	A storefront sign.	1
6634396	Then you're just then you're back to...	1
2261506	But presumably it can't, under that agreement, release more than the farmers can use for flood control purposes without the agreement of the parties.	1
6735422	But you're trying to say that this expert was not really an expert.	1
1255946	What, in your view, would make this a prohibited transaction?	0
8089878	if you view the prior disciplinary action taken by the employer as final, subject only to some kind of collateral attack in a grievance procedure, then it is final unless, at the end of the day, the grievance procedure is successful.	1
2253894	It's very hard to understand how the Ninth Circuit ruling comports with what we said in Ray.	0
11094	What's the matter with stopping transient health of adverse health effects?	1
4535741	[Laughter]	1
13693	That's what puts it into the category of a third degree felony.	0
4953597	It doesn't... at least to say what... whether the crime was a misdemeanor or a felony, the disclaimer certainly to... to say, now we are not labeling this person a forever sex offender.	1
6341139	It didn't say it in... it said prompt judicial review, whatever that meant.	1
2470301	But then Mr. Feldman tells us they have an option, if it wouldn't work out for them, to spread it back over--	1
239973	If that's denied, you have X number of days to go to the State Supreme Court.	0
8182496	dangerous for me to...	1
3216129	The appellants say that the court's just wrong or the expert's just wrong to say there were more heavily Democratic precincts with white populations, with heavier white populations that were excluded.	1
3404955	[Inaudible]	1
4577566	But but your isn't isn't...	1
7407431	I mean, why is this worse than those?	1
1383920	And that was a new provision?	0
8696005	You don't think it even mean Tribal Court, do you?	1
937199	I think you are reading something in that isn't there.	0
5379045	--And you think that based on smoking and health is a reasonable way to say, that regulates assertions of?	1
739814	This is all very important, but on the legal question that we have, do you take the position that it's a single body of water--	0
6530627	But why isn't...	1
274926	And that seems to work somewhat against your interpretation.	0
3883805	encourage it.	1
3952050	teacher recording and making...	1
935905	Would you tell us how you differ with petitioner on what ought to happen here and why?	1
545884	I mean, it just gives them a very impossibly short window.	0
6744584	--Right.	1
4077497	up- u- Absolutely, and a- absolutely...	1
1579730	Once...	1
1085748	In other words, there are...	0
9492182	General Waxman, whose First Amendment interests are being burdened?	1
2972320	I don't think if I read that complaint, I would read it as one that was proceeding on a veil-piercing theory.	1
2113268	and that's all. And...	1
1436898	That's correct.	1
873019	Now, after the trial court resolved it and denied relief, then there's no review mechanism other than filing an original writ with the court of appeals?	0
2355807	with people...	1
1686548	What's it going to do?	0
3566894	What is to be done in those cases?	1
1237132	How should we interpret Taylor?	0
3457730	to to receive that--	1
245119	I guess my question is, is it rational speculation when you know it's not true?	1
5348235	no limit on what they can do here.	1
1780561	You are responding as though there were no special burden to show some deference to legislative choices.	0
2141527	And is it still done that way?	0
4965912	timely objected.	1
1538366	--Mr. Dreeben, you seem to be... the Government's position seems to be somewhat of a shifting target.	1
6316489	Why is that?	1
9530267	Just what we said he shouldn't use.	1
567220	This is the fact that...	1
7533054	Now, this case is 14 percent.	1
5385315	What we said in Penry One was that that is not necessarily clear to the jury, but we didn't say that it was irrational.	1
1366928	Is that a jurisdictional defect or is it not?	1
4244588	unduly onerous...	1
8795066	--based on the information that they had?	1
9478684	You said something in the beginning about--	1
5435293	You're talking about general zoning laws that preclude not just tobacco billboards but all billboards.	1
2125015	And certainly I think... I agree with Justice O'Connor.	1
7018331	It seems to me the strongest argument against that, and I haven't heard you assert it... maybe I should have asked this question of the Solicitor General, but it seems to me the strongest argument against it is, if you do look to the underlying claim and say, has there been a substantial showing in the underlying claim that a constitutional right was denied, it seems to me then, even if the procedural ground from which appeal is immediately sought is entirely clear, even though there's not much of a doubt about the correctness of the procedural ruling, you would have to... you would have to allow appeal.	1
1391848	And... and the person injured may never know about it.	0
4520887	Let me ask you to comment on... on one thing--	1
4157018	But if they are using Levin money, it's a crime.	1
5094559	I... I think weren't there about four relatives who testified?	1
4932915	can perform --	1
2823141	Yes.	1
3222008	Past defendants?	1
870004	That's... that's just very hard to understand.	0
2257789	If you want to get a check instead of water, you can always negotiate that out.	1
8170837	Los Angeles was concerned...	1
4633061	Now that's  the issue here, isn't it?	1
4696149	So I take it your argument is you can't argue that this differential treatment is rationally related to the promotion of... of riverboat development or river development because the Iowa Supreme Court has definitively determined that that was not the case.	1
2244749	You have probably labor relations problems as a result of having somebody put at risk on the job.	0
36146	--What about the psychological reports, Mr. Verrilli?	1
6713232	It is not passive.	1
4395587	I don't see why the fact that it's boiler plate cuts one way or the other.	1
6883417	If it should turn out in the future that States are shown to be violating intellectual property rights of others and that States are not providing adequate State remedies for such violations, would Congress then have power to enact section 5 legislation to remedy that lack?	1
1549085	The old text said, no statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes.	1
3791408	We opened this session of the Court today--	1
18082	trial work statute itself says that any services rendered by an individual during a period of trial work shall be deemed not to have been rendered in determining whether his disability has ceased.	1
1965651	--and it excluded private schools.	1
519298	But it was argued.	0
882101	Before it had ever gone to trial, to a jury?	0
6188227	Well, could you put it... could I ask you to put it this way.	1
6066306	Did you file anything in State court after this particular notice?	1
9442072	But there was a... there was a determination, at least in Hendricks, that you fit... currently fit into a certain category.	1
6455522	Then you don't need reliance on Bennis at all.	1
1005187	And was there evidence at the recent habeas hearing that at least one of the sentencers relied on the fact that the judge thought Stumpf was the triggerman and the murderer?	0
5316036	It's the taxpayers, isn't it?	1
5118056	Right.	1
4274220	Well, that's why Ms. Williams...	1
8819143	Now, is it authorized?	1
4289365	That is... I mean, I read your brief.	1
1842938	I sh- I sure do.	1
1862845	Counsel, it... it looks like the instruction to the jury said that a defendant may only be found guilty of the conspiracy charged in the indictment if he joined the conspiracy at a time when it was possible to achieve the objective of that conspiracy.	0
58798	What would be the situation if there were truly a vacant position at US Airways in customer service? Would would you think the ADA would say that it would be a reasonable accommodation to consider a disabled employee for placement in one of those...	0
8412791	Well, it just looks like a lot easier argument to me than equitable tolling.	1
6178459	can assume that if...	1
7014282	or how?	1
3374440	and coming back and...	1
8091914	benefits for somebody who's already d- okay...	1
2856481	it is a lot like it is a lot like the loan.	1
1408007	Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate?	0
1807312	It puts quite a burden on the State.	0
3359036	Well, in this case, has the court below directly ruled on whether there's a 107 cause of action here?	1
1573336	that the commission...	0
122748	And I can't quite understand how imposing an extraordinarily high tax on racetracks is suddenly going to provide a benefit for riverboats.	1
1483510	He must be diligent going towards the investigation of the traffic stop.	0
8021937	[Laughter]	1
3142847	I'm on 23.	1
6440993	--Well, let counsel answer.	1
974837	on wages.	1
2708920	And the other thing that brings up is your point,	1
3279773	Does it apply in the prison in this case... the Rehab Act?	1
2702242	A spending limit is a spending limit.	1
168994	And the judge just says the prosecutor's arguments are just that, they're not the law.	0
9339567	--No, they thought... Nierotko was very simple, really.	1
3737822	With respect to working --	1
2140166	Was there already the affecting commerce notion--	0
1293916	I... I didn't find it.	0
2836107	Assuming it does--	1
1584885	Let me ask you, if we reach the question of what standards to apply, it doesn't fit comfortably in any setting with which we're familiar, strict scrutiny, rational basis test.	0
156963	That's the problem.	0
6738909	I want to be very clear on this.	1
2106147	[Inaudible]	1
1667692	And what we see today is a series of sentencing schemes that have imposed greater restrictions on the sentencing judge, given them narrower options, is that correct?	0
553567	You're claiming a constitutional right, as is usual in habeas cases, so I thought you were saying in the second part of your argument that it doesn't make any difference.	1
283433	There also are due process allegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand what the precise due process violation is that's alleged.	0
2032696	It made the decision that it was probable cause.	0
1627503	Mr. Robbins, I was thinking when you were making the argument in your brief, of what you would say the Eleventh Amendment means in the kind of claim you say that the Secretary of Labor would bring against a State for violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act where the recovery would go directly into the pocket of the affected worker.	1
4723147	consistent...	1
2128352	What is a medically significant health effect?	1
1501820	I... I didn't find it.	0
3253732	Do you think that incumbency protection is a permissible justification for a gerrymander?	1
939219	Well, you don't have to say anything.	1
2867566	So, the distributor gets the fuel and incurs the obligation at that point, whether or not it's resold.	1
8339502	materials...	1
2179696	But that that didn't happen here?	1
7296250	Mr. Waide, is it... is it your position that a plaintiff is always entitled to get to the jury in a case like this if he establishes that the employer's stated, articulated reason for the employment action is false?	1
1052836	Would you say that that was a factor that ought to be considered, even though the membership was predominantly private?	1
2121928	And that was denied.	0
7427772	us...	1
1702329	I think that would...	1
8264226	cit-	1
3365541	Isn't he also going to have to pay the sub in this case if the State is wrong?	1
2475876	You say you signed a promise here not to by your own words.	1
4242100	I thought we just went over this.	1
832718	Well, that might affect the decision of whether they are seamen covered under the Jones Act.	0
468927	--before you have to sit down.	1
2740727	That doesn't tell you who is appealing.	1
807456	The school obviously can set the hours and the days and the opportunities for all these groups.	1
8270705	Well, the impairment...	1
392824	It made the decision that it was probable cause.	0
3272383	I do accept that proposition.	1
8211004	true? Is that what having a foundation means?	1
1691656	What about the case cited by opposing counsel, Behrens.	0
2146980	Now, the dog, Your Honor, is different.	0
9461690	Both.	1
777382	expected?	0
1448965	Well, you're saying that at no time in the previous reviews of this judgment was adequacy of representation dealt with?	0
422176	There's no bar in California to going back as many times as you want if you have a new claim each time?	0
3755819	And I'm asking if any of those procedures have ever been... exist with the tribe or have ever been pursued by other contracting parties?	1
1487728	I mean, I think your client lost basically.	0
6597269	because, after all,	1
1252345	One is, as I think you're suggesting, that the time reasonably required to complete the traffic violation means that time and nothing else, so that any delay attributable to a dog sniff as opposed to other--	0
3000761	Does the record tell us if there are any private, substantially equivalent league which is... well, any league which is made up of all private schools which is substantially equivalent?	1
5150305	And there's no doubt that that water causes some of the damage, but surely not even half.	1
5125013	Is that a significant figure?	1
860269	Are... is this a... a scheme that is applied to such a person that poses constitutional problems, do you think, or does public safety rise to the level where it can be responded to in this fashion?	1
8693126	around it's...	1
1610559	Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of action, is it?	0
693517	So, as I understand it, he does want a stay in order that this can be heard.	0
461428	Yeah.	0
1191503	--The formal test no, your Honor, that would not be the case at all.	0
961461	Well, it is a nonrefundable credit, and that means that you can either use the credit as an offset to your income tax, and what you're suggesting is they don't have any income tax.	0
7826176	They're both out, aren't they, and under certain terms and conditions?	1
2925144	[Laughter]	1
5327393	If black acre has coal in the hard form, and it's right next to white acre, and white acre does not have any coal in extractable solid form, and you drill on white acre, and you begin draining gas from the adjacent coal field, are you in white acre?	1
1147623	And is that possible, in your view, under this scheme?	0
8170037	It isn't clear to me.	1
2022860	But the idea...	1
9054539	There's some question about that, isn't there?	1
7724763	Well, now it's clarified...	1
6730661	What... what is the basis of the... is this some kind of a facial challenge to the whole scheme of regulating noncontact visits?	1
4981110	But let me ask you... let me ask you a hypothetical I have.	1
313669	Well, Mr. Frederick, that just isn't the immunity statute.	1
7493408	The mirror image of that might be that you have 100 percent immunity if a substantial purpose of the facility is irrigation, and I guess the problem with that from your standpoint is that we're just stacking the deck.	1
180826	Why why did the court of appeals avoid addressing the work approach? It was it because it thought this Court had rejected that?	1
265040	I was waiting for the second one but just before we get too far away from it, what was the second?	1
5730775	Yeah.	1
3455603	And what do you rely on?	1
3837182	Your expert, Mr. Weber, said that the defendant's expert, Mr. Peterson, used an unconventional, untried theory.	1
1309534	I have not specified something.	1
1058215	I -- I follow the root of shocking the conscience when it comes to categorizing this type of a claim.	0
8206851	--look at a glass of fluid and say that's coal, or, you know, a balloon filled with some gas and say it's filled with coal.	1
8008980	Yes, but her question didn't just ask you about the Eleventh Amendment.	1
2585565	Under the Court's contribution to candidate lines of cases, putting aside the question that we're talking about contributions to political parties, and not directly to candidates here.	1
4264111	This methane comes up, they take the methane, but it--	1
3242281	community or if they don't...	1
2361708	or entered them in the grade book.	1
1288877	Are... are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?	0
8466128	used specifically  here.	1
5933057	Is this--	1
6407618	Well, in today's world I think we all are aware that water can be severed from the land and sold, so much an acre foot, for application on a different piece of land.	1
3047679	Of course,	1
119982	that the participation required the prisoner to describe previous offenses...	0
5176894	Well, I thought maybe it had something to do with the fact that all of a sudden it was valuable and the Federal Government thought it would like to have that value.	1
8467868	Well now, that's a different question.	1
1611715	I I respectfully disagree.	1
3212867	Others say you have an opportunity to show that you're no longer dangerous.	1
3239294	term...	1
4581156	[Laughter]	1
726550	Yes, but, again, I -- I think that falls for the most part within his Fourth -- Fourth Amendment claim, which was dismissed. So, to continue with my argument --	0
7821667	That's what this was, in the public domain, was it not?	1
6475350	I know.	1
9341253	institutionalized...	1
2994023	Don't you think the Doyle case cuts against your position somewhat?	1
3093351	But in this case...	1
8646278	[Laughter]	1
2645450	It may mean something different when you're talking about a state court and when you're talking about a Tribal Court.	1
7153720	Like the right to exclude on the part of the tribal authorities?	1
1805611	For example, it has, as I understand it, requirements that there be watertight doors and those doors have to be set above the level of the floor so you couldn't roll a handicapped wheelchair or something over it.	0
4339325	Everything except the coal, but did they know exactly what the coal was?	1
7811643	Well, the attorneys for the Federal agencies dealing with it certainly took that position.	1
7872671	Did it prohibit that, too?	1
645956	Right.	0
7612631	That's what I want to know.	1
822085	dangerous example...	1
1432667	You are assuming that there would be appeals in which the lawyer signed them... filed them without ever signing anything.	1
3352748	"A second rational way to do it... I don't how easy it would have been but I assume it could have been done, would have been with a definition of deliberately and the question the second question I guess, which instructed the jury that a person of some degree of retardation simply does not... is not capable of the mental process that ""deliberately"" assumes or requires."	1
8856925	Okay, what is your authority for this broad initial proposition you're making?	1
2548913	Your Honor.	1
9093008	That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.	1
8987452	Or something more?	1
5602438	I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.	1
951004	What didn't come in as a discrete item came in as part of the whole gambling operation.	1
6105671	come from, first of all.	1
9485263	Where do we find what you're talking about now?	1
6868512	I understand.	1
1682875	[Laughter]	1
7619974	Do you think that's a permissible political activity for the legislature to get involved in?	1
1274490	That's not what this Court has held, i- particularly in United States versus Janis, where in fact the assessment there was based on an estimate of wagering taxes.	0
8575509	Suppose at that point the dam itself started to leak and caused damage.	1
1659692	Is that what you're saying?	1
7887829	able to...	1
418537	-- Go on ahead.	1
8098918	No problem.	1
9373770	So Mr. Phillips was right, then, in his statement to me that there had been no technological change during that period of time.	1
2790981	United States.	1
1629865	I suppose that would be your argument.	0
6866401	Well, of course, 285 does mention parties.	1
3217725	--Okay, but is that properly before us here?	1
8672322	I don't see how (E) covers this situation--	1
8011205	Compulsion, that's the language in the amendment.	1
6904187	wanting...	1
6256153	And you argue that the limitation is $1,000.	1
1964464	That the ship could engage in racial discrimination while in U.S. ports on the selling of tickets and the provision of accommodations while in U.S. ports and within the 3--	0
8791578	But obviously you're holding up one that's a rectangle, so it makes sense to have the posts on either side, as opposed to the diamond shape, where it makes sense to have it in the middle.	1
6409441	I was um, you know, it doesn't matter.	1
8887902	I mean, let them fall where they may.	1
6185065	phase.	1
370318	the treat- -- One-	1
3148295	is in our joint appendix Your -- oh, no, no, it's in the petition.	1
3152421	How does this violate the student's right to free exercise of religion?	1
4356486	--Let him finish answering the question that somebody else asked.	1
1742453	Is future dangerousness an issue in Missouri?	1
5549432	Excuse me.	1
2130049	be. That's what you said in your brief.	1
246395	And it seems like the First Circuit went backwards from Chandris back to Giovanni which basically had been rejected.	0
4504505	how you got there. Uh-huh.	1
2439010	I mean, it is clearly overbroad.	1
8515067	Even though the people who have made up that rule are the very same principals of the schools that would be sued individually?	1
2519114	address...	1
353109	Then the term, as this Court has repeatedly said, those terms are relatively fixed and understood.	1
6941357	It's a kind of garnishment, I guess, and that's what makes it a little different from the ordinary contract case.	1
7222958	this one has a foundation.	1
461208	This is a religious test.	1
1327664	It...	1
494125	--Mr. Feldman, can I just ask, you may have covered this, but in the red brief, toward the end of the brief, there were a lot of anomalous examples.	1
2214511	Ah, but I said, is where it is, and it's not in the San Joaquin bed, which is where it would be.	1
5484596	y- the-	1
2133223	that's actually...	1
4303083	and...	1
4657470	I just want to get clear on the point that you and I discussed a minute ago on your exception to the Master's finding that you should have known in '69.	1
3750567	employee or something?	1
3222622	--I suppose you could also say that even though literally it would apply to both situations, there's a longstanding tradition of not applying it in the case where the statute has not run, and so you would construe that exception rather narrowly.	1
4993806	--and you allege knowingly sold worthless property.	1
2008051	Let me ask, in the context of this very case, the officer sought summary judgment on the qualified immunity issue.	0
4371544	There's... on occasion... I... it seems to me that case... opinion perhaps represents a decision that a particular claim is logically antecedent to another one, and it seems to me you have a hard time saying that here.	1
27227	That would be within its authority, wouldn't it?	1
2324651	If you think about questioning -- if the officer starts questions about where the person is going and that kind of thing, you don't -- we don't want officers to have to make finely-tuned judgements in the moment about whether the next question he wants to ask is sufficiently related to the traffic mission or not.	0
3790607	You're claiming a constitutional right, as is usual in habeas cases, so I thought you were saying in the second part of your argument that it doesn't make any difference.	1
4716438	On the whole 300,000?	1
106215	Yes, and wouldn't that routinely show up something like this, or--	0
7846224	in fact...	1
4899143	--What is the Government's position on a State law that prohibits adult bookstores from having a sign in the front which says, adult bookstore, or a sign that says, pornography on sale here--	1
4163313	And therefore, when you earlier made the argument that there is something very... something less than credible in the State's claim that it's merely trying to inform the public when, in fact, it makes no differentiation between current dangerousness and un-current dangerousness, the answer is there is... or an answer is... there is a very high recidivism rate, and that high recidivism rate does support the claim that there is something that... that it is credible to say that by publishing this information, we are simply trying to inform people of a probability of dangerousness, leaving them to do what they want.	1
8924442	Well, except Gwaltney didn't really get into the circumstances expressly, and I guess Steel Co. did, so we have to reconcile that in some way.	1
1668067	With respect to a party not being named at all.	1
7165532	--But explain again what you mean now?	1
1950354	The witness was a witness before and after, but would Texas allow that witness to be a competent witness?	0
554020	Are they stateless...	1
722370	I think the Florida court has sort of ignored that old Boardman case.	0
7436559	evidence...	1
8483886	year.	1
1004916	I know that's what you're arguing, but we have not done that.	0
9126851	for sure that it's not.	1
8504347	--Your Honor, allow me to disagree with that justification.	1
6620211	That's...  that's correct, Justice...	1
1898055	proceedings.	1
6151764	That isn't an absolute principle, and it... it has all sorts of exceptions.	1
651488	--Well, if we think it isn't altogether clear and in fact could be read the other way, don't we have to consider Chevron deference?	0
723590	Or maybe you can come back to it and your cocounsel can try to find it.	0
1429394	Now, should we make any allowance here?	0
4429746	Well, I... I thought you were talking about Justice Scalia's--	1
2843787	They... they knew who to copy the first time.	1
7016943	Well, if... if that's so, Olano's fourth prong, if you will, is that the error... asks whether the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.	1
2940261	Well, but it's a question of Federal law as to whether that includes a nondischargeability claim.	1
1656542	I think that does create arbitrary results from the perspective of the intrusion on the individual.	0
7621839	That wasn't the hotel operation in Ashcroft, was it?	1
5747524	They said about...	1
7508631	Thank you, Mr Draper.	1
130182	Now, in a State like that, is it the case that in applying AEDPA in this statute of limitations, that we exclude all of the time for decision making as well as that statutory time within which to file the appeal?	0
1117851	There is --	1
7674215	And we have a representative of that commissioner here before us today saying that under the statutory and regulatory scheme, that payments such as these for foster care are in the best interests of the child.	1
7039423	And,  well, true.	1
6825999	I... I think weren't there about four relatives who testified?	1
5211414	[Inaudible]	1
4283365	Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?	1
574175	Well, you got interrupted a bit.	0
10758	It might be more difficult and expensive to extract the coal, but the coal itself is no less valuable, is it?	1
1835579	In a trial situation it can usually be assumed that the defendant does want to continue the litigation.	0
4473565	--need for a--	1
205276	It just ran out of money.	0
8874888	It doesn't have the implication that it's a waiver only as to Tribal Courts.	1
9022700	What page?	1
8064189	Not all of those items are forbidden, Your Honor.	1
262942	Well, I guess that isn't before us here--	0
8768746	in two years...	1
8379108	and it...	1
6668105	Thank you.	1
7368345	Thank you, Mr. Uelmen.	1
469189	The... the statute says, pursuant to the Equal Protection Clause.	1
1556056	--And that would lead to arbitrary results.	0
8091271	So, it's hard to look at it as a field preemption case.	1
8840525	What kinds of acts would be forbidden?	1
2420085	What is the intelligible principle in the statute.	1
6684549	But in response to Justice O'Connor's question, there are no exigent circumstances of the type that would eliminate the need to knock and announce at all.	1
6537741	--It's (b)(2)(B)(iv), and 323(b)(2)(C).	1
1533872	It can be a reasonable accommodation.	1
6140021	[Laughter]	1
2136157	But why isn't...	1
1011935	Yes.	0
1761038	Well, you say that they cannot be one producing zone anymore, so that if you have, let's say, a pool of methane that is surrounded by limestone, but it is contiguous to a coal bed, you wouldn't be allowed to drain... you would say they're taking away your coal, that they have no right to that methane even though it's fugacious.	1
6059883	Is...	1
8479082	[Inaudible]	1
6320566	Well, you could ask them to just look at the contract rate and, if need be, make some adjustment to that because of the fact that they won't have to...	1
2365007	They must have it.	1
7988645	--Oh, I don't know about the Eleventh Amendment.	1
8475326	[Laughter]	1
5862843	because --	1
8319377	Well, could... could an arrest made under the circumstances I described be valid?	1
1170875	Every regulatory measure that goes too far is... is not criminal punishment.	1
8084403	--Wasn't that your answer?	1
2286554	He was denied admission, I think, in 1997?	0
606303	Let the public make... you know, the later... later determination.	1
137844	Are you suggesting there would nonetheless be this inference and the child could be hauled up and sent to the juvenile court?	1
6614340	But I would say the...	1
7155853	don't just have a...	1
8322045	He stands up and says on the record, Your Honor, I wish the record to show I've been asleep for an hour during the key cross examination.	1
9313374	Well, wasn't that a fear...	1
5128547	Well, yes, it is.	1
490487	Is it a court on the moon?	1
4552271	Mr. Dellinger, are you suggesting that there is some different standard of proof of facts in these cases or that we should not review a factual determination of a clearly erroneous rule?	1
6035605	In this case, did the plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer confusion?	1
8290412	And yet that's a tremendously intrusive burden on a political party's rights as well, isn't it?	1
6355029	presumably at the same level.	1
6523069	Is it some kind of affirmative misrepresentation?	1
3548823	The state is making agreements for work to be done in the state.	1
6745002	think that the practice around the country of various towns and cities is to require permits for people to go door to door in residential areas? I think I even live in a community that probably does that.	1
5128873	Is the rate... is the rate for taxing other gaming activities on the riverboats different from the slot machines on the riverboats?	1
84647	Yes.	1
112166	Yes?	1
4049791	A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market.	1
5818275	ninety-one.	1
182127	the sorts of things...	1
6907213	Not cases like this where there is a low success rate, and where the language of the statute says a reasonable fee.	1
6038801	--before they're disrupted by a Federal judgment.	1
1957779	Well, what about the... our decision in FCC v. Beach, which was just referred to earlier, where it says it really doesn't make any difference what the actual facts were?	1
4305939	the tips weren't as great as you think.	1
3744076	In this case I suppose it follows from your argument that all of the rules and regulations that are promulgated by the association are promulgated by a State entity, correct?	1
783206	there is no...	1
891156	It's...	1
5340564	Is that case cited somewhere?	1
5460191	Mr. Sutton, do you think if somebody said would you please sign this check and I typed my name on it that I would have signed it?	1
9058495	Did they exist in 1985?	1
573456	Do... do beneficiaries of SSI funds have a Federal right that they can enforce through a section 1983 action to have the representative payee act in their best interests?	0
1556159	--it's very difficult, frankly, to know whether it's product packaging or product configuration in many cases.	1
9311814	You treat it as though all of the expense incurred in borrowing money went to the outside nonunitary business.	1
9517883	We reserve the right in the future to dispense with... retroactively with any of the elements of the crimes that we have defined in our... in our code.	1
1552060	Denied counsel, and they were also dismissed at some point down the line?	0
6261689	That's the same question.	1
7972592	Well, presumably you could question supervisory employees who prepare payroll records and ask them how much have you paid these people, if anything.	1
9246113	Your Honor, and that's not what United States versus Janis would require.	1
1800975	Now, what's the arbitrator to do with a provision like that?	0
591122	about.	1
8182006	So at least as to those women I don't see a protective purpose.	1
6809018	But wouldn't...	1
2383603	Well--	0
4634097	If it violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, I can't see how the State can get around it by announcing in advance that it's going to... to violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.	1
479048	Now, there are certainly times when you go beyond the traffic stop.	0
4839463	petition.	1
5359103	Any distinction between the extent of deference to the Treasury regulations and the revenue ruling, or is it the same?	1
3606607	Absolutely.	1
51145	Do you have any response to that?	1
2877563	Well,	1
7098435	Compulsion, that's the language in the amendment.	1
5624811	--but... but I don't think you carry the day on that point.	1
1501883	So are you here to say if Washington State's legislature said that for a burglary conviction that a judge can sentence anywhere from 10 to 20 years.	0
9151050	Can we infer all appropriate relief?	1
145643	to obtain punitive damages.	1
3937271	--Yes.	1
1382638	Well, do you say that we are precluded from considering that authority as we resolve this case?	1
8736237	That seems to be--	1
6799135	But they now say they don't.	1
6144063	entitlement...	1
7468375	So the penalty... it's the penalty.	1
3879350	Mr. Baker, are there not courts where something like this would come into the clerk's office, the signature is lacking, the clerk would say, well, it was filed within the ninety days, so we'll send it back with the letter, very much as this Court does.	1
340820	and ability to perform.	1
3723356	Under what section of the labor code?	1
1556973	But this is such a new sort of a requirement you're seeking us to develop here.	1
2198559	What we do for judicial economy is you make the decision here, now, because the Eighth Circuit would have to do the same thing.	0
9516192	But if...	1
523725	But you think that the implication of this statute is that the court has to base it on the agreement of the attorney and the attorney's client?	0
3800245	the laws...	1
8372930	You...	1
1404596	Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented?	0
8649600	You said Ohio is now attainment area.	1
1241511	Yes, and wouldn't that routinely show up something like this, or--	0
2226583	The trial level court did make that decision.	0
3627740	I'm frankly attracted to the latter approach.	1
8834989	Isn't there a difference... and maybe there isn't historically in Tennessee, but isn't there a difference in the fact that intramural athletic contests are sort of accepted as a standard part of the educational scheme, whereas State provision of electric power is not?	1
2688357	Well, it doesn't say that exactly, does it?	1
6922201	Look, this happened in 1969, over 30 years ago.	1
5375308	And and that the Ninth Circuit felt that because this was a constitutional right that the defendant was h- had that was being withheld from the defendant because of the of the circumstances of this case, that the the district court erroneously presumed that it was prevented from going in a in a in a direction that the Ninth Circuit felt that it could go.	1
2720344	It...	1
2485597	Mr. Shipps--	1
8310753	Now, it may very well be that if the cost is so horrendous, that there is... that there is no implementation period in which the cost would not be very great on an annual basis.	1
513761	Jurisdiction under Habeas Statute?	0
4194247	You might need to.	1
2044310	Mr.... Mr. Sutton, the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 does say that a pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer--	1
415870	So is there no mechanism whereby suit could be brought demanding that a certain area be closed because of the impairment?	1
7925973	No, no, You don't have to commit yourself, but that's presumably what would happen or what the state would try to make happen.	1
5210728	Now, that happens not... that happens not to help the respondent here.	1
877356	Well, you you...	1
1685705	Do you say that there was probable cause for the arrest of all three at the time they were found?	0
167183	--Well, it was an option--	1
8347984	Do you think the States would have reacted differently whether they knew how this case would be decided?	1
1748878	and...	1
8381934	That isn't an absolute principle, and it... it has all sorts of exceptions.	1
1258556	--Go ahead.	1
5553003	I'm skipping	1
7793328	Well, is that right?	1
7115815	If it isn't a Fifth Amendment right itself, what is it, and how do we have the power to--	1
499909	It is used in the proximate cause sense, and that is an element of -- of the analysis in those cases.	0
9372347	Because the relator would have suffered an injury in fact?	1
6735466	I thought that's what you wanted to ignore.	1
7152412	Well, because...	1
708880	He needs money.	0
9380840	[Laughter]	1
5473751	considered.	1
4433448	Well, the Federal Government didn't adopt your position until very recently, until this thing became valuable, and until then the Federal Government took the position urged by Mr. Phillips.	1
6790407	But you're not entitled, you say, to say smoking's a good thing within 20 feet of a school.	1
5782507	--Oh, I don't think that follows at all.	1
8315610	in the proposed...	1
706487	Well--	0
8394572	which would be...	1
1168011	There may be a claim under what I perceive to be the substantive due process clause.	0
4777085	He was going to be dismissed for the next year, and it said, you know, we're terminating you.	1
1123065	participates.	1
4321825	So they can use that shape and color, presumably.	1
3001930	Yes, and other things, destruction of property and so forth, I suppose.	1
2971879	other...	1
7166297	I mean, if I were assigned the task of going over these records, I would think that would be a good starting point for me.	1
589649	As a practical matter?	0
1811784	Well, doesn't... doesn't the statute basically leave it to the commissioner to... to evaluate whether a representative payee is acting in the best interest of the child?	1
6694396	All right.	1
6724347	on wages.	1
8838409	I mean... you say that, you know, you could draft your own form, right--	1
479435	What number?	1
2187347	--was bashed in?	0
424834	Suppose that it is commercially feasible to extract the methane without affecting the value of the coal estate.	1
5853974	They just weren't easily available.	1
1107177	Well, the question wasn't asked you.	1
747503	Thank you, Mr. Thompson.	1
5090826	the policy?	1
5699724	If you -- then why isn't it true? Suppose there had...	1
3281898	323(a) is directed to the national parties.	1
2236131	Well, the big one is just...  it's too small to see.	1
6211377	But in today's world, the figures, the statistics are staggering about how many narcotics are brought into our country by way of the use of gas tanks.	1
3623105	The statute places the burden on the Government to prove that its position was not substantially justified.	1
3565521	There's simply no...	1
8504904	of judicial proceedings.	1
2593679	Would you explain... to make that clear to me, would you explain to me, as I asked your brother to do, what, then, on your view, the differences are between the old preemption section, assuming that, what was it, prohibition had been added to requirement, and the new preemption section?	1
1541024	And that is a fundamental wedge between the associational rights, political parties in an area that even Senator McCain admits is fundamental to the democratic process.	1
361820	--this statute incorporates the intent to intimidate feature.	0
3148817	Supposing Massachusetts passed a law which said, every cigarette pack sold in every, or let's say every billboard ad, has to take out the word cigarette, take out the word tobacco.	1
5633765	in aurally.	1
8326965	Yes.	1
1692852	So the religion... the bona fides of the group have to be reviewed by the prison authorities.	0
2799088	Well, doesn't the general rule 8 governing complaints... isn't that adequate?	1
5659165	Well, I guess what happened, perhaps, was the district court handled this at a time before we'd handed down Steel Company.	1
42502	But these tenants didn't let it get to that stage.	0
7384736	You concede that by saying each substitution affects the compactness and appearance.	1
671005	ninety-one.	1
4845261	here.	1
2050471	Yes, Your Honor.	0
6040474	Is there any suggestion here that the respondent can show cause and prejudice for the procedural default of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim?	1
9198130	But in order to say the number is no good, you're still challenging something which, at least on its face, has been authorized by FERC.	1
4998038	If the methane comes out in drilling, as in gaseous form, and I'm a chemistry student, is the formula for the methane gas the same as the formula for, say, hard anthracite coal?	1
8246870	Yes.	1
1360338	But it doesn't include States?	0
1085357	In your view, is this very fact-specific so that it might come out differently if the money and the drugs had been located in some little pocket next to the driver as opposed to some rear seat passenger or other passenger?	0
4843602	from now.	1
2684682	Now the Texas court of criminal appeals found that the supplemental instruction was a nullification instruction.	1
1844084	Well, Ms. Fuentes, you know, we don't have a lot of evidence here about exactly what Agent Cantu did.	0
7827573	But that you didn't need... you didn't need any new legislation to toss that out.	1
300329	The first of the key sections is section sixty-two oh one.	0
315127	We waive that and May 1 is okay.	1
1344020	You would always look at the underlying claim, so that even if the underlying claim... if the underlying claim was statutory, or based upon a treaty, and then in the disposition of that claim the procedural right that was denied was so fundamental that it was a violation of the Constitution to deny that procedural right, and then the violation of that procedural right is sought to be appealed on habeas, you would dismiss it because the underlying claim, after all, is not a constitutional claim.	1
1712948	Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented?	0
9306349	Yes, but this is in some ways a sort of derivative cause of action that Trinko brings with...  with the primary injured party probably being AT&T.	1
282347	There are additional facts...	1
903897	I mean, I thought there was a distinction between your trying to show in a case like this that the rational purposes that are advanced simply are not served... that's a factual matter.	1
1501821	Congress acknowledged that the a-	1
4454712	And if we were to grant you standing here, wouldn't we have sort of expanded our existing holdings on who has standing?	1
9122350	--What's wrong about warning the public about who may be dangerous?	1
7958991	Well, that would...	1
8828694	That's your position?	1
1342635	There is nothing presumptively ineffective about not filing an appeal after a guilty plea.	0
8458335	And I'm concerned, if we say it's not income, that there may be other items that are currently considered to fall within section 61 as income that all of a sudden we find aren't.	1
809765	Ms. Brinkmann, do you know what exemption is urged by Salomon Brothers to cover them?	0
4681532	Well--	1
3961819	[Laughter]	1
5020539	The securities laws have prophylactic purposes.	1
121640	months.	1
4628936	I would have thought the health would be a lot better if we just said no pollutants.	1
9054245	Or maybe some application could be made seeking closure of some areas.	1
2193416	Why?	0
5737840	--It would, Your Honor.	1
7463660	Well, I think we may be playing with words.	1
797397	Do you know?	1
5860398	We're going to look at all the circumstances.	1
5709450	Well, I... I thought they would intend it in order to show special respect for the processes of the State, so that a State has completely exhausted all of its procedures for determining what the law ought to be--	1
3622840	Assuming the Government never intervenes, as it has a right to do in one of these actions, would it be res judicata on the Government afterwards?	1
1237412	But I suppose this Court would.	1
4837309	But this isn't a question of State law.	1
2428342	My... my question I guess is this.	1
6282893	They set up some procedures, you don't like them... sorry.	1
4095273	What they don't like here is no interlocutory appeal I gather.	1
4296656	So the rule you would have us follow does result in a... a super technicality in a sense of what... what was on the record at the time of the plea.	1
1919506	Well, fine.	0
2139369	But it... it's a 2-year statute of limitations.	0
7467652	circumstance where a cus-	1
2822915	You showed what happened in the past.	1
889248	Well, General Waxman, certainly in theory a State could provide adequate remedies for violation and could, indeed, apply correctly Federal patent law in doing so, could they not?	1
267968	Wherever it is.	0
1046161	And looking at that, where do we stand today? We have how many States have no death penalty at all? Is it...	0
6647420	Yes.	1
3036175	--I would assume we would accept that finding.	1
3233120	Oh I I I think that would be...	1
8672611	And what if a... a claim is spelled out that necessarily must be based on a Federal right to exist at all?	1
792198	--All right.	1
6071424	[Laughter]	1
2851910	E-	1
4447712	That was just simply a contract case, and we said you couldn't do it without a prior hearing.	1
3558272	Mr. Mashburn, you have three minutes remaining.	1
5953113	How would you characterize the Ninth Circuit rule?	1
660128	I believe so.	0
278958	Now, should we propose such a rule or adopt such a rule in our supervisory capacity?	0
5600257	But as a practical matter, what would happen to the coal miners who are trying to take out the coal and at the same time releasing gas, if your position is correct?	1
6753994	--Right.	1
3572196	You're not saying that the Attorney General was breaking the agreement.	1
867100	Your coal deposit is next door.	1
8061401	Pick up your crest and go on, Mr. Alter.	1
3680144	Well, precisely.	1
2101210	I mean that's such an odd posture in a sense it's very awkward to say the least.	1
5231670	But the idea...	1
8136848	What happens...	1
1051788	Thank you, Mr. Stein.	1
2009411	That's the problem.	0
1624581	He said I want to fill this.	1
1093244	--that's different from the ordinary taxpayer?	0
4226868	Right, but they're saying that at the standard-setting stage the question is not risk management, the question is risk identification, and we identify the risks by bearing in mind these various countervailing factors.	1
5685467	--Well, the... the evidence was quite clear.	1
7547486	He can't...	1
6081916	I thought you were asking to do more, not to leave... to say the Ninth Circuit test is no good, because it's wholly-related... not-unrelated won't do.	1
123374	Yes.	1
2190229	Your Honor--	1
559090	But it doesn't include States?	0
1954256	It goes from 1727 to 1741.	1
4205781	So your basic... one part of your basic rule is, if the plaintiff isn't barred by laches, then the defendant shouldn't be hit with prejudgment interest.	1
7681700	That is what we look at, not the construction of the Central California project.	1
661583	Now, the court below didn't deal with the Privileges and Immunities issue, right?	0
1120032	How long was it in effect?	0
9366900	At least... at least--	1
5674816	So why does it make any difference if they simply, instead of picking one percentage, charge 5 percent on the parimutuel and 34 percent on the slot machines?	1
1091358	or entered them in the grade book.	1
5455335	On the other hand, if it were a drug-selling neighborhood or around a park where drugs are frequently sold, would it be legitimate in your view for the police to take drug-sniffing dogs and walk around the public street where cars are parked around that known drug-selling area and see if they could sniff out some contraband in the cars?	1
5470304	Okay, but they're not... I mean, this is a preliminary pleading issue, so they're not in the record of this case, and we'd better... I suppose we had better be sure of that before we come up with a rule that requires apportionment.	1
9404838	What it could...	1
8481416	I mean, if water is... someone is drowned in a boat accident as a result of flood waters being released out of a dam, you have a single incident that occurs right then.	1
90982	The awarding authority?	1
1982561	How far does this go?	0
72158	Well, why is the prime's right of little value?	1
757229	Well, I don't know that we would...	1
372538	tips that they may have...	1
7065140	Isn't that correct?	1
2602815	existing here.	1
9162816	with.	1
4043556	Well, two things...	1
9163887	appropriate punishment.	1
8210811	[Laughter]	1
1015529	Well, what kind of a line should we draw then?	1
2976624	Is a substantial... if we said the... if flood control is a substantial reason for the facility and for the operation that caused the damage, could you go back for trial on that?	1
6779411	And if this...	1
5110368	and endowing police with...	1
4466374	[Laughter]	1
1387458	And this claim was denied?	1
8965559	Thank you, Your Honors.	1
905459	these things.	1
57739	Well, don't we have to give some weight to the EEOC view?	0
1141841	Mr. Marcelle, does State law require this school district to open its facilities after school to other groups?	0
8069132	Well--	1
3083424	That is the law of California?	1
628708	But, so I--	0
6049177	appropriate punishment.	1
7202586	I mean, as far as the Federal legislation is concerned, a State that tells the whole truth... is that... that kind of law is totally acceptable within the Federal requirement, isn't it?	1
6279867	typically.	1
3382601	--And what's the... what's the answer with respect to a State pardon?	1
8006065	Is it the commerce clause?	1
904789	Yes, Congress has done nothing about this, has it?	0
225231	--So I mean, and that wouldn't put the burden on us to try to figure out how you compute money damages for failure to deliver water.	1
9201020	suppose the  --	1
471217	Well, if we look at the language of the statute dealing with the final decision, we look at the fact that it was a dismissal, so we say, okay, there's jurisdiction.	0
8252440	Well, now, the parties presumably could agree among themselves in the contract what law to apply.	1
449094	Mr. Phillips, this is a facial challenge?	0
4924860	taking away something.	1
8431637	Do you think the statute requires that one particular method be selected or does it leave it up to the judge?	1
3681448	And that remains.	1
3923218	But you go on to say, but it's not constitutionally significant.	1
1771693	in the Sea Clammers case and Smith V Robinson.	1
8984245	But they still recognized... the FEC has still recognized that the national parties are, in fact, national parties, not Federal parties, and therefore, they can spend 35 percent on allocable activities, even in a Federal election year as in 2000 when the RNC gave $5.6 million of non-Federal money to state and local candidates.	1
2014292	Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented?	0
2389635	Mr. Robbins, we'll hear from you.	1
6064069	Is everything that is bad regulation punishment?	1
5358440	I think--	1
5926260	Has anything changed?	1
7382218	Well--	1
2708140	Do you know...	1
4927486	But what is the basis upon which you claim that you have or should have a right to fill the wetland.	1
825117	[Laughter]	1
861843	tips on there.	1
9326942	That's very odd.	1
5651251	it is a lot like it is a lot like the loan.	1
9317991	contracted workers...	1
5828151	St-	1
5681877	I just find the juxtaposition in this statute difficult to overcome.	1
4067694	Your Honor. And B two A is --	1

1547102	Among other things, there's a claim that the land use plans for San Rafael Mountain and Henry Mountain require certain very specific things, that the land use plan, for instance, for one commits the Bureau of Land Management to finish an off-road vehicle designation rulemaking by 1992--	0
1040889	Pardon me?	0
2792655	Mr. Everett, the one thing that puzzles me about that argument is in this footnote 25 in your brief, when you try to answer the question, what swaps could be made, and you give a few examples, and in every example the result would be a more bizarre shape, not a more compact shape.	1
297272	assessment in this case.	1
6444040	I thought we just went over this.	1
6540304	I mean, can psychiatrists --	1
7795569	One... one thing that makes it more difficult perhaps than it might be to see your side of the argument... go back to the Chief Justice's question.	1
1089572	Did you ever  did you ever apply for a permit? So you don't know, as a...	1
1225618	Well, but now, Mr. Curry, I thought that a majority of the Federal circuits to have interpreted this very section, (e)(2), have articulated some kind of a fault requirement, if you will, on the part of the defendant.	0
5640048	So what does the judge do when the judge hasn't speculated in advance about this possibility?	1
1819878	Well, again, if I -- if -- the formal -- the formal handing of the ticket is not the end, in your example, Your Honor?	0
3734729	Is it theoretically possible that the legislative council could be... which enacts the rules could be composed of a majority of private school principals?	1
2727506	right?	1
5733010	Well, do you have other means to get the information?	1
199765	And the district court didn't deal with it, and then it went to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and it didn't deal with that issue, either.	1
3231067	[Inaudible]	1
9629206	Maybe it wasn't error.	1
4893532	Based...	1
2801246	[Laughter]	1
8939446	Right.	1
9102646	And of course, which except for property damage wasn't even necessary, because the Federal Tort Claims Act--	1
4870951	Is that correct?	1
5192789	Mr. Sarnowski, can I ask you about your interpretation of 2253?	1
4716736	Well, you didn't answer my question.	1
5511788	Is that all right?	1
1242952	That is part of the stop.	0
1240744	know...	1
9204963	Why not?	1
5209617	I'm telling you what it is.	1
5700939	Your answer is right the second time, wrong the first time.	1
3020198	Reply brief?	1
325776	He needs money.	0
1979071	Yes, Your Honor.	1
9226737	The investor doesn't care whether that's a fixed return or a speculative return.	1
4410528	Yes.	1
726598	Once the act of the traffic stop is done, which would be the reason, which would be the purpose for the stop, once that is done, that is the--	0
2162865	if But short of...	1
8748006	And the reasons are?	1
81675	What if... what if the tax were imposed, or a tax were imposed on the hotel itself instead of the guests?	0
6175300	Mr.... Mr. Sutton, the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3 does say that a pro se notice of appeal is considered filed on behalf of the signer--	1
6096968	ther-	1
2010054	--in connection with a birth?	0
6243182	We analyze it just under that provision.	1
5008583	The whole problem is that he wasn't given an opportunity.	1
195376	"""Oh, it should have been somebody else. """	0
9092467	In the second part of your argument you're now assuming that signature just means a typewritten signature, so I assume it would follow that if you left that out, it will also be properly filed.	1
5807138	I mean, what is... there are only to my knowledge Tribal Courts, federal courts, state courts, what else is there?	1
2220076	But there... apparently Wal-Mart didn't object to those instructions, and we're not here being asked to find that the instructions that were given were faulty.	0
2839786	Was probation a possibility?	1
1992052	It's page 25 of the joint appendix.	0
5270780	We had a case a couple weeks ago and it rose out of California contracting and problems with that.	1
9081372	Wisconsin...	1
9272757	If a banker or securities dealer were convicted of... of... of a crime, could the Government after the fact... prospective... pardon me... retroactively... retroactively require that he or she file their... their earnings statements for the rest of their life with some regulatory agency?	1
7032099	Well, it's the one we're focusing on.	1
4463533	All right, so we're going to have to have some kind of mechanism to apportion causation for jurisdictional purposes, don't we?	1
9630876	And here we have to deter...	1
8036513	three of seven.	1
4397594	98 percent?	1
4478716	I mean, the... but the... my thought was, and this might be totally wrong, that it isn't that the... you know, the fact that something was done in the Middle Ages is not, whoever Holmes said, a reason for following it, so let's start with the Restatement rule.	1
7556359	Yeah, but the Court went on to say that this was a free exercise violation as well as a First Amendment violation.	1
8896376	I... I understand that the... the percentage of sex offenses in Alaska with children is extremely high, and what is... has been the effect of this scheme if it's been employed?	1
553526	defendants who believe that kind of thing.	1
7219255	--It's not provided it doesn't cost too much--	1
6554907	At the end of the...	1
5531396	provisions of the rule.	1
849478	twoA.	1
7408063	Although you do say that the bank keeps a record of each client's signature, by which you mean pen and ink, right?	1
5079160	323(b), the restrictions on state parties, usurps law by imposing this Orwellian definition of Federal election activity which sweeps in virtually, virtually all activities of the state parties during even years, subjects it to a Federal $10,000 limit and then perhaps most invasively imposes the homegrown requirement which makes it difficult, if not impossible, for states to transfer money among themselves.	1
8352257	But wouldn't...	1
20639	--Well, it does on its face.	1
216402	True, it didn't spell it out, but if you look at Heikkila and Accardi together, there's some indication of support for the position of your opposing counsel.	1
2018102	I... I just... I just don't understand your theory.	1
1232383	Well, perhaps Congress should have used different language.	1
1950266	Well, I'm not just saying anything about pro se... just someone types in his own name and two other names of people who were parties in the district court but who haven't signed it.	1
9284108	Yes, but as Justice Scalia has pointed out, it did amend and broaden the preemption provision at the same time that it banned all advertising in electronic media.	1
1926508	of proof.	1

411339	That is something that the -- that the courts are looking at as to whether that is something that you should be able to do.	0

5275140	tax.	1
6483437	Right.	1
875641	There was a stipulation in the record that the activity fund is administered in a viewpoint-neutral fashion?	0
4222332	that.	1
4516199	Rather than getting into all that, why wouldn't we assume that the States didn't want to unless they said it specifically in the compact?	1
4442121	So that what we do will make no difference in the... in the ultimate result in this case.	1
6819687	Mr. Dreeben,	1
4312673	thing.	1
1559912	Yes, Your Honor.	0
1448769	You said you'd give us some reasons why this is important to the Government.	0
1865869	Are... are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?	0
276789	Well, this is the kind of thing that the Coast Guard could require, isn't it?	0
1404813	petition.	1
3983370	If I may read Yes. Thank you, Justice Stevens.	1
968797	And is that again a reasonable time period within which to seek review by that mechanism in the court of appeals?	0
1860845	Do you... do you agree with the interpretation suggested this morning by Justice Breyer, for example?	0
9563955	arsonist...	1
4387895	Did they look at it from that perspective and say as a matter of Texas law it was a nullification?	1
4833810	Well, there's a big difference between being, say, in Seattle, Washington, and Ellis Island, never being able to get off the island.	1
7953709	from innocent people.	1
474152	Well, now you're back into the merits, aren't you?	0
4906679	Well, but I take it under the registration form we're talking about, that the date of the conviction is there, and the... the citizen can make up his or her own mind as to whether the conviction was so long ago that they're no longer worried about it.	1
1418935	Have your...	1
6789684	[Laughter]	1
4137705	preponderance when it comes in the MS PB...	1
965353	tips on there.	1
824800	[Laughter]	1
8300219	Now assume, for the sake of argument, that we don't accept the analysis for purposes of Federal equal protection.	1
1707081	There would be a duty to advise...	0
2053633	[Inaudible]	1
6589755	I'm not sure what the judge is supposed to do if this court says one thing and the legislature says the other.	1

8302538	thought that Hart relied on the negative health effects of the arcade.	1
7046310	You... all you have to do is file a motion under this PLRA and say, we file a motion to terminate the ongoing relief.	1

2696720	in this case.   Yes.	1
8607570	drug...	1
1221850	States...	1
4865929	Did you ever ask the prosecution whether Farr was an informant?	1
9329274	The person is still dangerous.	1
276065	And I just wonder whether that's valid.	0
8006769	I...	1
2560875	Is there anything in the record--	1
7136592	Is--	1
645028	What do we...	1
1652954	Are you relying on the Pend Orielle case?	0
46256	From you.	1
1075826	tremendous...	0
4424098	What about the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920?	1
1034212	It remains...	1
3032043	It appeared to be the assumption that the Oneidas did not have to go to Kansas, if they chose not to do it.	1
7978901	That's not your job.	1
410057	cable companies...	0
7541277	The... am I wrong about that?	1
5842073	Well, when they say constitutional right, certainly I take it it would no longer be available to raise a claim under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, that the State court had violated that.	1
6890049	Suppose you have a case in which 10 jurors are excused because of their expressed views on the death penalty, excused by the State.	1
922636	And that's why they're doing it.	1
3150723	They certainly don't apply retroactively, but what constitutes a retroactive application of them is another question, and I don't consider it a retroactive application of them to say that they apply to all cases that seek an appeal after the enactment insofar as their provisions governing appeals are concerned.	1
568030	The facts that are left is not enough to -- to establish any type of reasonable suspicion.	0
8037600	It covers any funds that the party has, so it is prophylactic.	1

1091276	I just...	1
4916856	It isn't just wrongful.	1
5060832	Mr. Feldman, what would you think the result should be for someone whose capital conviction and sentence became final after Apprendi but before Ring?	1
5167315	But, you do--	1
7191800	of our brief,	1
4734701	We don't want to do it if you think it will hurt you.	1
2288733	say. I'm pre-	1
7645099	There was not a stay and abeyance used here.	1
7241300	They are designed to protect people that put their money in the hands of other people who are running business...  businesses...  and from whom they expect to make a return.	1
1682567	What Equal Access Act are you talking about?	1
3890029	After 1985, the United States says, we're not going to be owners any more.	1
2661792	The Freedman case seemed to require prompt judicial determination, didn't it?	1
4325936	Yes.	1
1524468	No, that's given. I I assume it's not a contract.	1
1984257	For life insurance proceeds, and even though it says the same exact words, does not... gross income does not include, we know that those do up the basis.	1
2969981	Right.	1
632974	Well, why isn't the Turner/Safley rule quite adequate here to deal with this?	1
5275670	In your opinion, when did the taking occur in this case?	1
4500805	When you say this instruction, you mean the instruction that is set forth as well on page 5 of the blue brief:	1
4490485	Explain to me whether we've ever bifurcated forum immunity from immunity for suit... from suit?	1
799750	And I thought that we had to address this facial challenge insofar as it affects the new policy.	1
2353966	And that seems to work somewhat against your interpretation.	0
475019	Mr. Roberts, how do we determine what the patent covers?	0
5580001	So is it a step to say they can implicitly agree the same thing?	1
8293867	I see.	1
3807208	defense by that scenario.	1
7362947	Are there any indications that any of the police in this instance will face disciplinary action for their response here?	1
